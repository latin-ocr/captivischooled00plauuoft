94 Norsss. [11 2. 85—95

[85. Pol hic qtu'dem huius est cluens. If spoken byTynd. (MSS.) this
must be an ‘aside,’ huius referring to Philocrates, who is standing
near (see 43 ,Quare hac me saltur). In this case the next line must
be explained as meaning that it would be easier to negotiate with a
private person than with the state. No doubt it would be more
natural to speak of Menarchus as the client of the father of Philo-
crates; but Theodoromedes has not been alluded to since 68, and
therefore haias ean hardly refer to him ; we must suppose that the
erilis filias here represents his father. Lind. and Brix give the
words to Phil„ and make huius refer to Tynd„ consider-ing the
exclamation, and the coniparison of the next line as more in the style
of the character which Phil. is assuming, and Ι have followed them,
though is the words Pol—cluens are an ‘aside,' they, at any rate,
are an ejaculation of Tynd. ‘in propria persona,' called forth by the
piece of news which he hears sor the first time. Ussing retains the
words for Tynd„ but explains lanius as ‘merloy' δεικτικῶς, as in Cure.
11 1. 33, ete. But this is very forced]

86. Hoc i.e. the return of your son—[esse in procliui expresses the
idea os a facilis descensus, and the opposite of the Eng. ‘ uphill work.']

87. Pac, ‘see to it.’—[sed te id oro. At this point Tynd. leads
Heg. asido, in order to maintain an air of seerecy in making his pro·
position]

88. ab re, see note on 46.

89. ille, Philopolemus.

90. hunc, Philocrates, disguised as Tyndarus—aestumatum, i. e. a
certain sum of money having been agreed upon as his price, to be
forfeited to Hegio should he fail to return (meo periculo 99, tua fide
101). The (restauratio follows 103 seq. in the ordinary form of eon-
tract (simulatio, see on 1 2. 70). [ΕΙ-11( strikes out te aad keeps ut
(aeramv quaeso, u]t aestumatum), comparing v 1. 29; with te quaeso . . .
des, ef. 11 3. 72.

91. misero, see note on 1 2. 85.
93. iusseris, sc. perferri. On the quantity of uelis· see Intr. A (ii).

94. nihil est, with an infin. following, ‘It is no good 3' ef. Cas. 11
4. 7, Hor. Sat.. 11 3. 6.—operam luseris, Cist. 11 7. 2, Pseud. 13. 135,
Ter. Phorm. 11 2. 18 ,- more commonly operam perdere, e. g. Aul. 11
5. 15.

95. transactum reddet marks a completed state, transignt an aetion.
Such periphrases formed of a transitive verb like facere, reddere, tra-
dere, etc. combined with a perf. part. pass. are very frequent in the
eomic pects, (1) with facere, eg. missam aliquem Amph. v 3. 2 3 (2)
with reddere, eg. lenitum Bacch. v 2. 31, perfectam aliquid Asin. 1
1. 109 ; (3) with tradere, eg. hoc ecfectam tibi tradam Cure. 111 15 ;
(4) with clare, e.g. factam et caratam dabo Cas. 11 8. 3 3 (5) with
curare, eg. inuentam tibi curabo Ter. Andr. 1v 2. 1.
