(4) The Codex Ambrosianus (A), a palimpsest now in the
Ambrosian Library at Milan. The original MS. of Plautus
belonged probably to the 5th century, and if it were preserved
entire at the present day, would be an authority of pai-amount
importance upon the text of the whole of Plautus ; but in the
9th century it was taken to pieces‚ and ruthlessly washed and
scraped3 upon the parchment thus prepared a copy of the
Vulgate was made. The original writing is therefore exceed-
ingly hard to decipher, and about two-thirds of the leaves are
entirely lost. Of the Captivi, all that can be read are a few
traces in two passages (IV 3. 5—V 1. 12, and V 4. 26 to the
end)

Of the MSS. above mentioned, a collation of B and J * is given
in the Critical Apparatus of this edition ; occasional reference

’κ’ Mero variations in spelling are not usually indicated, especially where
they represent the customary orthography of the MS. in question. Thus
in J there are hardly any capitals, e often stands for ο (e. g. uersus), for oe
(prelia), for i (acc. plur.)‚ for u (eclenclifl z· stands for e (intellz'gso), for u
(optimus, surripuit), for y (T induras) ; o for u (adolescens) ; u for ο (seruus,
tuum), though the older spelling, e. g. ser-nom, is occasionally found3 y for
i (Phylocrcztes); c for t (e. g. ργασία, mancius), and conversely t for c (offa-
tiis); 933 for s (exspectut); h is often inserted (harus, hodio, hostiurm cf. on
the other hand, Eyio for Heqio) ; cl and π are assimilated to a following
letter (assiduus, attinet, affero, alloquere, imparatam, immittere, irroyabo„
·a est, -e est, -i est, —0 est, —um est, -us est, are written in full, instead of the
contractioris, -ast, aest, -umst, etc. 3 cui and cuius stand for quoi and quoius,
cum for quom: mihi and nihil are generally written michi and nichil, and
ae is constantly confused with e (eg. ledat, sepe, aequae) ; further, a pre-
position is usually written as part of the word which it governs (eg.
inseruitum, adte, interse), and other words are similarly joined (e. g. tehoc, ·
sipotes). But these peculiarities are not noted excepting for some special
reason. Nor have Ι thought it worth while to register all the vagaries
of J in the matter of the speakers to whom lines are attributed. In
1 2. 73—81, for instance, the greatest confusion prevails. Again, it has
been impossible, without greatly extending the compass of the Critical
Apparatus, to indicate all the passages in which J is illegible: this is
only done where a wrong conclusion might have been drawn ‘ ex silentio!
Corrections made by a second hand are always given m‘th the words ‘ by
second hand ;’ a word corrected immediately by the first hand is some-
times simply given as it was meant to stand, but generally the fact that
a correction has been made is noted—It should be added that it is only
in the case of J that this edition gives first-hand information. The sources
from which my stateznents as to B are taken are indicated in thc Preface.
