18. uisam ne, the same ne as in uide ne [aide ne sit = perhaps it is,
uide ne mm sit=perhaps it is not3 cf. Cic. pro Cluent. 35 mule ne

begins therefore in the morning.

19. Inde. On the shortening of the first syll, see Introd. A (v).

[22. conciliare. The radical meaning is ‘ to bring together‚' ‘ unite 3’
hence the two derivate meani11gS‚ (l) ‘to fetch’ (to bring to a place),

male taedet (Most. 1 4. 4). In these instances the adverbs employed
are of coqnccte maenius] to the verbs which they qualify 3 bene, male =
ualde, uehementer). [Add Lucretius 111 942 quod pereat male, and
