Plautine prosody which reflect the looseness of popular speech ;
nor are the few isolated facts which are ascertained about
Roman pronunciation at all sufficient to justify the usage of
Plautus in every particular. Again, though in many cases the
scansion of a word in Plautus warrants us in inferi-ing with
certainty that the ordinary pronunciation of it in his day dif-
fered from that of later times, yet as to the exact nature of
the divergence there is considerable difficulty in choosing
between several equally plausible hypotheses. There can be
no doubt, for instance, that fire‘nfarz‘us 111 Trin. 114. 55* (so
sedentem-ius in Aul. 111 5. 30) cannot be scanned as a word of
five syllables with the second long; but whether the peoplc
suppressed the first or the second vowel, or dropped the con-
sonant 11, cannot be determincd with absolute certainty, though
numerous analogies make the first supposition appear the less
probaffle, and the second the 111010 30. We therefore content
ourselves with a statement of 1110 leading peculiarities of
Plautine prosody, without atteinpting to base it- upon an ex-
haustive or systematic treatment of Roman popular pronun-
ciation.

In the first place, the fact is well authenticated that final s,
even in the time of Cicero, was sounded so faintly that, when
succeeded by an initial consonant. it did not necessarily make
the syllable long by positi0n3 this fact is mentioned by Cicero,
Or. ξ 161, who quotes several instances of it (0110 from Luci-
lius), and cominents with censure upon the poetae nori who
had begun to find it a stuinbli11g-bh›cl<. A final s therefore
may be entirely discarded in 3011111111ιὲΓ Plautus, even in the
last soot of the Senarius, or the Iambic Tetr. Acat. and the
Trochaic Tetr. Cat„ as: salros sis Rud. 1 2. 15, estis mmo ibid.
11 6. 28, occidistis mc Bacch. 11 3. 79, qualis sit Bacch. IV 5. 16,
perdis me Merc. 11 2. 52, luclzficafus ..s-it Most. V 2. 3.

Further‚ it is to 110 noted, in contrast to later poetry, that 111
dramatic verse a Mute before a Liquid never makes a naturally
