11 2. 70-84] NOTES. 93

70. auariorem, i. e. so as to demand an excessivo ransom.

74. Probably an interpolation from Aul. 11 1. 46 ; Heg. would not
have said nostium, which is quite in place in the Aul„ but meorum,-
[and the three sentences beginning Esse, Non esso, Seio esso, hang very
awkwardly together. A passage of similar sense occurs Trin. 11 2. Ga]

[76 is considered spurious by Brix as destroying the simple anti-
thesis of 75 and 77.—lutulentos, cf. Poen. 1 1. 30 lenone istuc . . . .
‘non lutum est lutulentae'us. Usa—The independent sentence with
indic. mood reddidit, instead of an infinitivo, subordinate to scio, is
quite in the manner of the comio poets 3 cf. sacco uenies]

77. Ter. Adel. 11 2. 8 pecuniam in loeo neyleqere maxumum inter-
dumst zemma—est ubi, ἔστιν ὅπου = interdum.

78. Cf. Prol. 44 aud note.

79. Here Hegio first discloses his plan of an exehange of prison-
ers.—hoc probably = huc, as in the same phrase Trin. 1 2. 28, Curc.
112. 20, Pers. 1 3. 36, Mil. 111 1. 169.—sentio, ‘am intending.’—
pariter, i. e. ‘as well as Ι do.'

80. Ah'de (without in, see on 111 4. 41) goes with seruit; a gene-
ral adverb of place, like illz'e, is often followed by a phrase denoting
more particularly the exact place where (412)ch uos Alide). Thus
foris illic extra scaenam (Prol. 60), illic sub aqua (Cas. 11 6. 28).

81. ne duis [sor the more common ne dederis; even in Cicero (ad
Att.. xlv 1) scribere η ffi'qrere} The subjunctive with oze is less
emphatic than the imperative, cf. v 1. 26. So Aul. 11 2. 61 ηε duas
‘ you need not give (a dowry)'‚ ib. (34 noui, we doceas ‘ I know it, you
' need not tell me' (compare 111 2. 20 scio, ne doce, noui), Trin. 111 1. 5
at τῑι edepol nullas credam& ‘there is no need whatever for you to
believe.'—[Tlie hiatus in the diaeresis of Troch. Septenarii is very
eonimon3 see infra 99, 11 3. 78. 89, 111 4. 21, 111 4. 73, 1v 2. 66, 1v
2. 80, 81, v 2. 23, 24]

82. amittam, see note on Arg. 7.

83. orare in early Latin often = dicere ,· thus in Plautus orare eum
aliquo, and even in Cicero (pro Rosc. Am. 26) re inorata, [and virgil
(Aen. x 96) talibus orabat szo (her speech had been anything but
a prayer), ef. Aen. vn 445.]—h01m'num hom03 this redunclaney
again, 111 4. 8, Trin. v 1. 1 1ηέ homost omnium hominum praecip-
uos. [On the quantity of es see Introd. R]

84. seruitutem seruire; again Trin. 11 2. 25. This ‘ figura etymo-
logica] (cognate accusative) is very common in Plautus, eg. dicta
dicere Trin. 1 2. 40, ficeta facere Bacch. 111 1. 12, statuam statuere
Bacch. lv 3. 1, moenia moenere Mil. 11 2. 75, speciem effecere, certa·
men cernere Cas. 111 1. 2, messem metere Trin. 1 1. 11, sermones serere
Mil. 111 1. 105, pietatem piare Asin. 111 1. 3, prandz'mn prandere
Poen. 111 5. 14.
