V. 4.
1. Acherunti, see on 111 5. 31.

2. nulla, the only passage in Plautus from which the gender of
Acheruns can be determined3 an older poet quoted in Cic. Tusc. 11
16. 37 has altae Acheruntis. [nulla A. is not so much ‘ no Acl1e1·on‚’
as ‘ Ach. in no wise, in no degree 3' cf. nullus εσσε( Ι don't a bit‚'
so totus 0902‘ I wholly.']

8. eccum, eccos, eccae, eccillum, eoois-(um, etc. (i.e. ecce eum, and

construction 3 so in the latter half of this verse, and in v 3. 203
see Cas. 11 1. 15 atque ea ipsa eccam eqreclz'tm· foras, Rud. 1112. 49

incedit, eccum adest often used in this way, but never eccum est, a

simple est being always omitted as in the former half of this verse,
