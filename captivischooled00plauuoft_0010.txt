readings. Ι have been able, however, to make a valuable addi-
tion to my Critical Apparatus, in a considerable number of
emendations by Richard Bentley, which are here published for
the first time. These I found in the Eritish Museum, written
in the margin of a copy of Pareus (Press Mark, 682. b. 10). A
comparison of these notes with other specimens of Bentley’s
handwriting leaves no doubt whatever that they are really
lssentley's own. But the best proof of their genuineness is
furnished by the readings themselves, which could only have
prccccded sroni a scholar of Bentley's calibre. In one passage
(111 5. 66, 67) the marginal correction is identical with one
proposed in Bentley’s edition of Terence* These readings I
have further, in the majority of cases, introduced into my text;
which, neveitheless, will be found to be on the whole con-
siderably nearer the MSS. even than that os Dr. Brix. In this
part of my work Ι have derived great assistance from the Criti-
‹eal Appendix of Dr. ΒΓΚ and the notes of Ussing (Vol. ΙΙ.,
havniae, 1878), besides these, I have used the editions of
Lindemann (Leipzic, 1830), lVeisc (Quodlinburg, 1847-48),
Fleckeisen (Vol. 1., stereotyped ed, Leipzic, first published in
1850), and Geppert (Berlin, 1859), the “ Plautinische Pro-
sodie” of Miiller (Berlin, 1869), the “Metrik der Griechen
und Roiner” of Christ (Leipsic, 1879), and the work of A.
Spengel on Plautus (“Kritik, Prosodie, Metrik,'' Go'ttingen,
1865). My special thanks are dne to Professor W. Studemund,
of Strassburg, who most kindly sent me insormation as to the
readings of the Vatican MSS. (B and D) in some cases in which
a doubt or difficulty arose.

With regal-d to the explanatory notes at the end of the book,

‘¹' Many os these emendations have since been independently made by
other scholars, among whom I may mention Lindemann, Fleckeisen, and
Dr. Brix. But among some fifty—three corrections in the Captivi, less
than one third, and these for the most part the more obvious oneS‚
are adopted from previous editsnxs. Resides the readings approved by
himself, which he distingnishes hy the word “leg.,⁷' Bentley has added
in the same copy os Pax-ens a collation of the most important variants of
the Codex Britannicus, to which he had aceess- as keeper os the Royal
Library at St. James’. These have some value, not only as showing the
respect that Bentley had sor this MS„ but because they were copied before
the MS. sull'ered in the fire which burnt the Cottonian Library (1731),
and accordingly in a few cases preserve a reading which is now illegible
