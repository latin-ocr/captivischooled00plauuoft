11 3. 22—43] Nows. 97

following other compounds in PL, abicere Epid. 11 2. 121, Rud. 111
4. 72, 111 5. 35, adhaere Capt. 111 4. 72, interbitere Most. v 1. 47,
perbibere :perire Pseud. 111 1. 12, Rud. Π 6. 11, praeterbitcre Poen.
v 3. 49.

22. pater, i.e. ‘your father ;' but there is an intentional anibiguity
in the word—[aliquem = alium quem, as in Virg. Aen. 11 48 aut ali-
quis latet error]

25. The longer and weightier trochaic septenarii introduce a pas-
sage of deeper feeling, the maledictio or parting—[adhuc locorum,
cf. inde loci Lacr. v 789]

26. in rem conducat = ex re sit.

[27. I have adopted the excellent emendation of Brix ; something
like smnper seems to be demanded by calliae locorum of 25, and this
would hardly be conveyed by persequar. ΒΓ. tells us that there is
the same corruption of the text iu Cas. 1 1. 5 quoquo [bis tu te pcr-
sequi, where A only preserves the right reading (scioque ta ibis te
semper sequi]

32. honore honestiorem, cf. on 11 1. 54. [The phrase is intention-
ally ambiguous. Tynd. means ‘Hegio treats nie as a master, whereas
I am really a slave.']

33. ne praecipias, a prohibition (ne is not ‘ lest') 3 cf. on 11 2. 81.
—memoria memini, cf. on 11 1. 54.-—tamen [‘ all the same'] at the end

of the line and the thought, ef. line 44 and 1 2. 78. So Amph.
1 3. 44 ut quom absim me ames, me taum absentem tamen.

[35. cum hoc with hiatus, cf. Prol. 24]

36. mora merast, ‘ would be sheer waste of time‚' cf. 1v 3. 6. [For
est cf. the phrases lonyam est enumerare, dicere, eto]

37. uicem, an adverbial accusative, connected in Pl. with a posses-
sive pronoun or genitive: ⁴ in place of us both,' cf. eri uicem 111 3.
11, uocis uicem Amph. 1 l. 181, meam uicem Most. 11 1. 8.

38. utrique is here prob. genitive ; as also in Aul. 11 1. 10 3 comp.
Pers. 111 l. 14 in. uentris rem uidebitur, and Ter. Hec. 1 2. 2⁵.—
[Poteris of the MSS. is probably an unskilful attempt to avoid the
hiatus after primum, and makes the line too long. Lind. as well as
Bent. strike it out. Gepp. reads poterit stuc, and refers to Lachmann

on Lucr. p. 197]

41. The bracketed words must be considered to be a clumsy inter-
polation on account of the repetition (me laic ualere 31), the meaning-
less antithesis εἰ tute, and the word audacter, which is quite out of
place here.

43 The reading of the MSS. me ad. tibi cannot be right, as te is
required in the next line as acc. before the inf. gessisse. [The mis-
take may have easily crept in, owing to a confusion in the mind of
some copyist, who forgot that Tynd. is here speaking in the charac-
ter ot' masten]
