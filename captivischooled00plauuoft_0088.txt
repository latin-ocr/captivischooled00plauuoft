7 6 NOTES. [PROL. 15—24

15. Qui potestis censerier‚ i.e. those sitting near the stage, the
wealthy classes (the senators and Equites), as opposed to the aswe'te
cens-i. [hut ope sor opibus, ‘ wealth,' is unparalleled. In the Roman
theatre the orchestra, being no longer occupied, as at Athens, by tho
Chorus, was reserved tor the scats of the senators. This arrange-
ment came into soree ΠΟ. 194 (see Livy xxxw 44. 5, and 54. 4—8
‘nt lom §suanm-iac sca-venereus a populo. olum anim in promtis-cm> spre-
lulutm‘), and probably at some date between RC. 194 and ΠΟ. GT,
places near the stage were also assigned to the Equite83 for Cicero
speaks os the law of Roscius Otho (67) as merely restoring to them
a right which they had possessed before iu some shape (pro Murena,
ξ 19. 40, equestri ordini restitnit dignitate1n).]

16. relicuom. The remainder of the ornamentum is compared to
the balance of a debt due to the opibus censi, for it is the wealthy to
whom dehts are usually contracted; es. ‹jis-t. 1 3. 40 nume qnod 7·σίιῖ-

here ‘1 slislike3' so Hor. Ep. 1 15. 16 num usna niln'l moror «illim
ονιιι». The root idea in this· expression was perhaps ‘I slo not dwell
upon (with affeeti011).’ Hence it was used (l) negyatlcely‚ in the
sense ‘ I am indifferent to' (eg. Virg. Aen. 11 :365 et esst-¹. m'l moror,
‘I eare not if Ι am'); (2) as an expression of positia-e (ιι-θνκῐωη, ‘ I
cannot bear‚' as iu the above passage from Horace. In the English
‘I do not care' there is a similar ainhiguity]

17. dixeram may mean ‘had said‚' i.e. at the time when I was
intel-rupted by the ‘ ultumus‘ (11>; hut perhaps it is here, as often
in plaut„ not a genuine praeteritum in praeterito, but. simply = dvlci

several times, eg. v 3. 5.]

[21. suo patri. The mention of another son and another father
just before makes it. necessary for the speaker to be very explicit.
The story is indeed somewhat eomplieated]
