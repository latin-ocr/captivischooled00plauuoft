INTROD UCTJON. 3

Tyndarus in reply reminds his master that it is he (Tyndarus)
and not Philocrates, that is running the chief risk.

Scene 4 (ΙΙ 2). Enter Hegio from his house. In the course
of conversation with the Captives, he informs them that his
own son, Philopolemus, is a prisoner of war in Elis, and then
leads the Pseudotyndarus aside in order to ask him some
questions as to the family and position of his supposed masten
the real Tyndarus looks on and expresses his lively satisfaction
at the skilful acting of Philocrates. The latter tells Hegio that
the Pseudophilocrates is of high station and the son of an
exceedingly wealthy Elean, whom he calls “Thensaurochry-
sonicochrysides;'' adding, in thorough harmony with his as-
sumed character, that the father of his young master is a
terrible screw. Hegio now turns to the real Tyndarus, and

that the Pseudophilocrates forfeit 20 minae for him should he
fail to return.

Scene 5 (ΙΙ 3) contains the leave-taking of Philocrates and
Tyndarus, in the presence of Hegio. Tyndarus, who feels the
danger of his situation, reminds Philocrates of the risk that he
is running for his sake, and while appearing to exhort his
slave not to seize so favourable an opportunity of making his
escape, and so causing him to forfeit the 20 minae, in reality
addresses a passionate entreaty to his master not to leave him
in the lurch nor allow him to fall a victim to the vengeance of
Hegio, should he discover the truth. The latter is moved to
tears by the affection which master and slave evince sor one
