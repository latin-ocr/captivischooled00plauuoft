proved, on the one hand, by the fact that neither in cases like
centia& Rud. 11 6. 26, where the accent has retreated from the
short syllable, nor in words like actas, mores, vineunt, nostros,
where the aecent falls on a long, is any shortening of the last
syllable permitted; and, on the other hand, by the fact that
even in abi, tene, tace, the last syllable recovers its length the
moment the pressure of the accent is removed, i. e. when the
word is pronounced slowly and with emphasis, as is commonly
the ease, e.g., before a stop: as, ‘ceni Men. Ι 3. 32, iube} Capt.
IV 2. 63, pave Pseud. 1 1. 101, Amph. V 1. 61, abi Capt. 11 3. 92,
Asin. 111 1. 39, vale Truc. IV 2, 42, Cure. IV 4. 32.

But the force of the aceent in prose, to which the Ictus
Metricus is very often equivalent, makes itself felt even beyond
the limits of iambic words; for combinations of words forming
an iambus assume the same liberty of degenerating into pyrr-
hics, when a word consisting of one short syllable (quid, quod,
quot, secl, et, is, pol, or, with elision of the last syllable, eqo, abi,
aye, qnasi, sibi) is followed by a long syllable with initial vowel
in a. word of 0110, two or more syllables, as qzco‘d &st Trin. ΙΙΙ 2. 4,
itast ibid. 111 2. 42, combinations which have the same effect
on the ear as potest, &c Thus we find among many instances:

the pronunciation in Elizaltethan English ‘i' the), aba· 11η malam.

But the influenee of the accent extended not only forwards
to the succeeding syllable, but also buckwards to the preceding
one; so that in words or combinations of words having the
accent on the third syllable, and the second syllable long, the
latter was shortened if the first syllable was short, because in
the rapid pronunciation of such words the voice naturally
hurried on to the accented syllable, and, while bringing it out·
