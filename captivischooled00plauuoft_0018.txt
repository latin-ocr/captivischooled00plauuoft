6 INTRODUCTION.

protestations of the Parasite at last compe] his belief, and he
promises that if the news is true, he will give him free board
for the rest of his life. Meanwhile he bids him pay a visit to
the larder and cellar.

Scene 3. Ergasilus abandons himself to the enchanting pros-
pect of a meal.

Scene 4. An interval must be supposed to have elapsed
between this and the last scene. A young slave recounts the
p1·oceedi11gs of Ergasilus in the larder, and the devastation
that he wrought among the eatables.

Scene 5. Enter Hegio with Philopolemus, Philocrates and
Stalagmus, whom he has fetched from the harbour. Father
and son pour out their gratitude towards Philocrates, and ask
how they can requite him for the honourable persormance of
his engagement. He suggests that the devotion of his slave,
Tyndarus, be rewarded ; and now learns sor the first time 1110
punishment which had been inssieted upon him.

Scene 6. Hegio, lest alone with the slave Stalagmus, takes
him to task for his offence in carrying off the child Paegnium
twenty years before. Stalagmus, seeing that evasion would he
vain, boldly confesses that he sold the child in Elis to a certain
Theodoromedes sor six minae 3 Hegio immediately recognizes
the name as that of the father of Philocrates.

Scene 7. At the eager sunnnons of Hegio, Philocrates re-
enters, and Stalagmus is sulnnitted to a cross-examination.
Philocrates at first denies the truth of the story, but when the
slave mentions that 111 1110 family of Theodoromedes the child
went by the name of Tyndarus, Philocrates recognizes in his
servant and companion the lost Paegnium.

Scene 8. Α1 11115 moment Tyndarus, released from the quarry
but still loaded with chains, appears on the stage, and is asto-

longer time than a few hours; and the same may be said of the sufferings
of Tyndarus. The poet's art, then, 1111151 he judgcd faulty, not because he
makes a postulate, but because he gives 111-0111111011ου to an idea in one
place which is inconsistent w'†h what he postulates in another. That
the whole action of the play 15 really contined to a single day may be
seen by comparing 111 1. 36, 37, 111 2. 2, 1 2. 2 (the numbers refer to the
ordinary division into five Acts).
