118 NOTES. [1v 2. ⁷2—91

72. nominandi istorum copia, for' nominandorum istorum or
nominandi ista, doubtless partly to avoid the unpleasant sound
of the former 3 we must explain the genitive plural istorum as
eo-ordinate to nominandi and thus independently and directly
governcd on copia. So Ter. Haut. prol. 29, nouarum qni spectandi
saciant copiam. Another possible explanation of the construction,
i.e. that the governing substantive and the genitive of the gerund
together form a single idea, which then governs the other genitive
case, cannot be applied to the great majority of instances without
violence. The construction occurs not only in Plaut. and Ter„ but
also in Lucretius (v 1225 poenarum graue tempus soluendi),
Varro, and several times in Cicero.

74. frustra as a troehee, see Intr. A (v).

75. cotidiani uicti, ‘ every day fare? In the sixth and the greater
part of the seventh century (A.V.C.) the termination of the genitive
of the 4th Decl. was -ἰ, or sometimes mis. So in Pl. we find only
the forms sumpti, quaesti, ΐιιηιιιίΐὶ, uicti, (semiss, senati ; the last
occurs even in Cicero—adferas. For the subj. cf. 85 J‘czcz‘as.

76. uotem, cf. 111 5. 45.

77. tu ne, ‘yes you’ 3 cf. Trin. 111 2. 8.
[80. Hiatus in diaeresis]
[81. Hiatus in diaeresis]

[82. propritim. This word is only known to exist in one passage
in Latin literature, Lucr. 11 975, where its meaning is ‘specifically ’
‘in particular.' Here the meaning seems to be ‘specially’ In
MSS. propritim, if written carelessly, would look exceedingly like
proprium. ΒΓ. reads propere unum, after Bothe and Lind.]

86. mi equidem esurio, as though Hegio had meant to join
esurire mihi instead of mila· uidere.

88. Te hercle. Erg. begins his sentence as though he were
going to say perdant, but checks himself, and gives it a different
turn.

90. nmio tu mihi places, with reference to the invitation given in
1 2. 66, which he was only hals inclined to accept cf. 111 l. 37.
cenam asperam-sero, after the trick played him by the prisoners,
Heg. is in no mood for a feast.

91. Igitur is used by Plaut. and Lucretius to mark with emphasis
the entrance of the apodosis, and may sometimes be translated by
‘then,' ‘thereupon' Thus Mil. 111 1. 175, qnando habebo, initur
rationem mearam‚fabric-arma daho, and Cas. 11 2. 41. So Lucr. 11
677, cetera consimslzf meniis ratione peramans (= cum perum-abis),
inuenies issitur multarum semina rernm, etc. Sometimes we find
issimr joined with tum, as Most. 111 1. 156. Iffl‘tnr tum accedam
hunc, qrmndo qnid aqam inuenere, and Trin. 111 2. 50. —olim from
οίίαο· or olus (= ille) means prop. ‘ at that (yon) time.’ Here ‘earlier,
