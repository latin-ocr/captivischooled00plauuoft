'74 No ΓΕΒ. [ABG. 8—121201.. 8

[but the conj. is in FL's text is feeble. Notice, too, the unusual
sequence of tenses]

8. is, Philocrates.

9. Indicio quoius, i. e. fugitivi—alium, Tyndarum. [The order of
words (Incl. quoi.) is not Plautina]

PROLOGUs—l. hos, attracted to the ease of quos [cf. Virg. Aen.
1 573 urbem quam &tutelo uestra est] and resumed by the hi which
follows, as istos 1 2. 1 by his. [In such cases, the speaker proceeds,
as it were, tentatively in constructing his sentence, instead of con-
sciously realizing it as a whole from the first, and thus a noun,
placed early sor the sake of emphasis, easily falls under the influence
of the verb that immediately follows it.]—stare. Although the pri-
soncrs do not take any part in the aetion of the piece until the
beginning of the second Act, they are present in chains on the ltro-
scene‘am during the delivery of the I'rologue. This would give the
audiencc an opportunity of getting to know their faces and dress and
so avoiding confusion in the sequel.

[2. Evidently a ι]’()1((>, παρὰ προσδοκίαν (cf. Trin. 111 2. 97, and
W'agner's note). But the reading Illi of the MSS. is corrupt and
makes no sense, for the same persons could not be called Hi in ono
line and Illi in the next; the word has been explained by some as
meaning ⁶ there’ (illic), but this is not consistent with lzz‘c in the line
before. Fleckeisen proposes l'z'nct‘i (μία, which cannot be said to be
probable.-ast0 is used in its proper sense of ‘ to stand doing nothing,
idle' (‘stand expectant' is often more exact, cf. Virg. Aen. 11 303,
arrectis αῑινίῖηιε adsto).]

[4. senex qui hio habitat, modelled on 1 1. 28]

5. suo sibi. This expression, which occurs again 21 and 1 1, 13,
is equivalent to suo ips& sihi does not ‹lepend on the verb, but must
be taken closely with sno in the sense of ‘his own.' [The phrase
cannot be analyzed graininatically; it is rather one of those combi-
nations calculated to [roduce au effect on the ectr. Plautus uses it
again Trin. 1 2. 119 redd-um suom sihi, where however sihi has more
‘raison d'eness as a dative is required after reddam, and sibi reprc-
sents ei as well. So in the single instance from Cicero (Phil. 11 37.
96 priusquam tu selum sibi venderes, ipse possedit), snum sihi stands
also in a close relation to ipse possedit. But the passage above men-
ti‹ ned and Ter. Ad. v 8. 35 sno sibi ῃῖευλίυ hum: y'chulo, arc more
distic-ult to justify‚ cf. Amph. 1 1. 116.]

6. operam dare, properly ‘to be at any one's service,' often in the
coniic poet< in the special sense of ‘to give one's attention‚’ cf. 54,
111 4. δῖ), Trin. Prol. 5.

[S. Alterum, to be pronouneed with syncope, altrum. The same
p1·‹›1uinciation is necessary to sean Pers. 11 2. 44 : thus dextera, clym-
troam-sum, ulterior, ultro, exist side by side 3 ef. surpuit for surripuit.
-The line is borrowed from 111 5. 102 3 cf. on Arg. 2.]
