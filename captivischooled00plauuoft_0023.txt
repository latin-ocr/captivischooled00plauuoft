with emphasis, neglected to give the preceding long but unac-
cented syllable its due weight. We may express this again in
a formula, thus: bacchius = anapaest. To such popular promm-
ciation, then, correspond scansions like the following: senectuti

These instances may suffice to give an idea both of the
extent and the limit of the intluence which accent may exert
in shortening long syllables, the limit being that the shortcned
syllable must stand immediately aster a short one, and either
before or after one upon which falls the accent in prose or the
ictus in verse 3 on the other hand, we may observe that the short-
ening affects syllables long both by nature and position, and
in the latter case can override not merely two, but even three
consonants. Thus the first syllables of inter, omncs, ipse, hercle,
iste, huc, haec, &c., are in themselves just as decidedly long as
those in summus, credo, sic, mone, and so sorth3 but in the two
combinations qzcz'd >inter and quid stater* they are reduced to
shorts by the rhythm of speech or metre.

Further, we are in possession of a few isolated facts which
make it probable that the weakening of quantity in certain
cases found a corresponding expression in spelling. Thus the
scansion in &culto is supported by the spelling with a single c
of 0110 MS. (the Decurtatus) in Trin. 111 2. 38, 863 and again
we may compare simillumae with the spelling scccz'lzcmecl in the
senatus cons. de Bacch. ; in the words eminere, operire, aperire,

’κ’ These shortenings produce the same rhythmic effect that is created
in music by a grace note before an accented (loud) 01· unaccented (weak)
beat. As iu music the grace note and accentcd crotchet are compressed
into the time of a single beat, so the syllables quidiste (a short and a long)
combine and together form a single long.
