26. Alide, name of the country, not the town; see on 111 4. 41.

27. Hic, i.e. Hesyio. [But this is harsh, and Geppert supposes that
some lines have fallen out after Alide. We should certainly have
expected to be told that Menarchus was a client of Theodoromedes,
which is an important fact in the development of the story (see 11 2.
85 seq.).—commercari. The prefix signifies ‘thoroughly‚’ as in the
Eng. ‘ buy up‚’ so coena), ef. comedo (ent up), comburo (burn up).]—-

Od. 1 17. 1 Velox cmzoenmn saepe Lam-etam Alzcz‘at Lycum Faunus.
In these cases mutare means ‘to take in exchange,’ and the abl. is
analogous to an abl. of price. On the other hand, we find in Od. 1
16. 26 mutare tristia mitibus, where it means ‘ give 111 exehange fors]

[29. Again the speaker uses every effort to make his meaning
clear, and to avoid any confusion of the son captured 111 war with
the son who is a slave to his own father]

[30. indaudiuit, a cortain correction. The old form of the prepo-
5111οη in is seen in such words as {ml-ipiswr, ind-uo, ind-ntiae, indi-
(sena, indoles, infla-perator. ludendo-e means ‘to catch the first
sound,' on the analogy of imbuo ‘to give afirst wetti11g,' informare

to give the first shape) Hence the idea of inzpevfectlon in these
ven-bs, eg. Ze'tteris Graecis intentas = with a sinuttering of Greek
learning]

[31. For the hiatus in the caesura minor, compare Men. 111 3. 3,

111 2. 30, Poen. 1 3. 34, ete. With this proper name there occurs
hiatus above line 24 and in 1 2. 60.]
