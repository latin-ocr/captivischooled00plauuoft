N OTE TO THE SCHOOL EDITION.

ΤΗΕ Introduction, Text, Critical Apparatus and Notes in
this book are identically the same as those of the larger
edition, which is published simultaneously with it and con-
tains additional matter.

The numbers on the lest hand of the text are those of
Fleckeisen’s edition. The Apparatus has gained in complete-
ness and consistency by the addition of the readings of D in
a number of passages cominunicated to me, since the appear-
ance of my Preliniinary Edition, by Prof. Studemund (marked
S), and by a second collation of J, made by Dr. L. A. P.
Schroeder. 1 have also much pleasuro in acknowledging the
help of my friend W. Y. King‚ Esq., MA„ who read the play
with his form at Loretto School‚ and sont me a list of correc-

tions and suggestions, many of which Ι have embodied in the
Notes.

I would call the attention of the reader to the note on
page 2 (Introduction).

In this edition a few misprints have been corrected, and a.
few changes introduced into the text.
