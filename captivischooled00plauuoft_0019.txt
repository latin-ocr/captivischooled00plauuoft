PROSODY.

That the prosody of Plautus ditl'crs in many respects from
that of Horace, virgil and Ovid, has been at all times generally
1·ecognized; but it was a gross misrepresentation of the facts
of the case when the practice os the poets of the Augustali age
was set up as an absolute standard to which verse of all kinds
and all times ought to conform, and whatever was at variance
with it inearlier poets was explained as a “ license'’ or a proof
of their barbarous versification. In Plautus, as in all early
dramatic poetry‚ the laws of quantity of syllables and their
adaptation to metre rest mainly on the usage of popular speech,
and exhibit essentially the same negligences and inconsisten-
cies as the pronunciation of daily life itself. A totally different
tendency manifests itself in the later reforming school of
Ennius, with its new metre, the Dactylic Hexameter. The
rhythm of this verse, with its inflexible monosyllabic arsis and
its nicely defined double thesis (os one long 01· two short), was
irreconcilable with the freer prosodic movement which had
been found unobjectionable in earlier verse3 it demanded that
terminations should be strictly scanned, and every syllable of
the language rigidly classified under 0116 of the two great cate-
301165, long 01 short. Thus for the Hexameter there grew up
a fixed law corresponding to the precision of Greek prosody;
while in the iambic and trochaic metres of dramatic poetry,
the usage not only of Ennius himself, but also of Terence
Pacuvius and Accius, did not on the whole constitute an
advance upon the prosody of Plautus; it was Catullus and
Horace who first extended the stringent rule observed in the
Hexameter to iambic measures.
