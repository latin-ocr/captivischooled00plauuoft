111 2. 15—3. 17] Norsss. 105

have therefore been content to give the passage as it stands in B
and J. XVhere the MSS. fail us as they do here, the problem of
restoring what Plaut. wrote seems to be a hopeless one]

[15. inde abii seems to be an interpolation 5 ΒΓ. transfers the
words to 19 (after ‹2aesolaz·.)]

17. hio, i. e. Aristophontes.

 

111. 3.

1. nunc illud est, quom, ‘now the point of time has arrived, at
which,' cf. Ter. Ad. 111 2 1 Nemo illud est, quom si ωηηῖα omnes
seca consilia conj‘erant . . . . aux-ili nil <afferant—filim& cf. note on
11 1. 50.

2. spernunt=secernunt or sez'zmsyuut <old Latin). For this rare
sense, cf. Ennius in Non. p. 399 ‘ias atque aecum se ιι medis spernit
procul.

4. neque adeo, cf. on 11 2. 98.—metum‚ ‘danger,' the subjective
for the objective idea, cf. Trin. 1v 3. 2.

[5. A versified gloss on the next line]

6. [fucis for trickery, cf. Cic. ad Att. 1 1 sine suco et fallaciis]—
ob uiamst = inpromptu est, adest.

7. perfidiis. For the plural, cf. on 11 3. 69.

8. hospitimtm cf. Most. 11 1. 3 nusquam stabnlzcmst confidentiae.

10. negotiumst. With the humour of despair he says, ‘there
will be no difficulty,’ instead of non clabiam 831,- hence quin in next
line. [The line is unmetrical]

11. malam pestem oppetere (cf. mortem opst), again Asin. 1 1. 7.

13. Philocrati may be either dative or genitive, as v 2. 22, and
Euripidi Rud. 1 1. 4, Herculi Rud. 111 5. 42, etc.

14. Salus seruare, a proverbial expression (again in Most. 11 1. 4,
—In si uolt, si :etscg as Amph. 1v 3. 17, Rud. 1 2. *Id—copia, abso·
lutely for ‘ help,' Epid. 111 1. 4 seq.

15. machinor. On the long final syll. see Introd. 11.-(101, of the
intellect‚ cf. eyreglz'e cordatus homo, Ennius (in Cic. Tusa. 1 9. 18),
and Pseud. 111 1. 3 quantam 690 nunc corde conspicio meo.

16. malum, ‘interiectio irascentis.'

[17. Incipisso and haereo form a hiatus ς cf. note on 111 1. 21, and.
Introd. D. ii. The line is a senarius, and corresponds to 15. Ritschl
has turned both 15 and 17 into septenarii, by adding ille expedimzdi

to the former, and writing the latter h
aereo

Nisi nugas ineptiasque iam incipisso maxumas.
But Tynd. has already said Nisi si aliquam machinor mestitiam, and
in the next scene he says m'sz' reperio aliquam astutiam (7). 'she
introduction of the same thing a third time would be monotonous]
