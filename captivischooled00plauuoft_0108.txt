96 NOTES. [11 2. 100-3. 20

110. Ad patrem nuntiari. In this phrase (again n 3. 24) the thought
is rather of an address- to which a message is to be taken, in patri n.
(11 3. 40) that of a person.

 

II. 3.

This is not really the commencement of a new scene ς for, as Les-
sing says, none of the characters have left the stage. Hegio now
steps on one side to inform the Pseudotyndarus of the arrangement
that has been made between himself and the Pseudophilocrates 5
after line 12, all three take part in the conversation.

1.) Quae res, referring to the principal clause that follows (uolt te
eras .

[4. With hiatus in caesura. For the order te aestumatum cf. 19.]
5. uelle for uelle se, cf. on 1 2. 85.

[7. nostris filiis. Probably abl. of instr. It might, however, be
(lat. commodi]

8. rectum. Part. of regyor, ‘guided‚ turned.' So Bacch. 111 3. 8
esso [Ilum haberem rectum ad z'nyenz'mn bonum.

[12. quom fers, ‘by bcaring.‘ So the German ‘indem du tra‘gstl
cf. note on 11 2. 106. 'she line has hiatus in the caesura]

[13. Gratiam and habeo form an hiatus, which Ussing considers as
partly justified by the fact that the vowel is the same in the two
words ,- he compares T er sunt conati imponere Pelio Ossam Virg.
Georg. 1 281, and capiti z'sclcmtmto Hor. Od. 1 28. 24]

16. qui me quid agitem perferat, i. e. qni quid eqo aqitem perferat.
llere the subject of czgsz'tem is taken out of the object clause, and
brought prominently forward by a kind of prolepsis, as the object of
the verb of the principal clause (pefferczt), as commonly in Greek.
So often after scio (Ti-in. 11 2. 96 Scin ta illam qno yenere qualus sit ?
Men. 11 1. 21 Εῃο illum scio qnam carus sit cardi meo) 3 [and also
after such other verbs as admit of being directly connected with the
subject of the dependent clause, e. g. flacci jacio (Trin. 1v 2. 150),
qaam-0 (ib. lv 2. 31)‚sa1172·0 (Pers 111 l. 54 necessitate me, mala utfiam,
situi-s). Our instance above is a somewhat extreme one, as perferat
cannot strictly speaking be connected with mc. But the rationale
osa usage must be sought in the simplest and easiest exainples of it;
as such, none could serve better than Capt. 111 4. 25, where the pecu-
liarity is hardly 110ticeable.]

17. ordine, ‘in due successim: i. e. ‘point by poiut‚’ ‘in detail ;’
so Livy XXXIX 14 omnibus ordine: &positis (καθ’ ἓν gutueram—[omnem
rem, an apposition to the clause qaid . . . . assitam, which it sums up,
thus being the final shapc which the object to perferat takes]

20. rebitas, from the old verb bitere or Ζιᾶίανα -- ire (Mero. 11 3. 127,
Pseud. 1 3. 31, Cure. 1 2. 54, mich. 1v 2. 25), which appears in the
