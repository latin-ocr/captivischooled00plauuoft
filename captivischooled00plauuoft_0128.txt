Furfuribus. The singular smjsar denotcs a ‘ husk, scale‚' the plural
‘ bran,’ as has been shown by A. Luchs (in Studem. Stud. 1. p. 56)

froin passages in Varro, Columella, Pliny, and Phaedrus. In line
30 the Mss. preserve the plural furfures,

28. odore z propter odorem.

30. Dominis, substituted, παρὰ προσδοκίαν, for scrofis—[exculcabo
pugnis, a mixed 1netaphor.]

34. qui (30. piscatores) aduehuntur, ‘ ride to market.'—crucianti‚
i.e. jolting.

35. quorum odos, ie. that caused by their 1111011 11311. [sub-
basilicani, ‘those under the portieoes of the basilica.‘ We are
expressly told. by Livy, xxvl 27. 3, that in the year of the fire
which destroyed a great part of the Forum (210 Be), there were
no basilicae at Rome; and the first mention that we have of the
building of one isin the censorship of M. Porcius Cato, ΒΟ. 184, the
year of Plautus' death (see Livy, xxxlx 44. 7). Hence Brix infers
that the present passage (and Cure. IV 1. 11) which make 111( ntion
of a basilica, must be of later date and not by Plaut. himself ; and
the ‘Dict. of Antiq.‚' p. 198, asserts that the Basilica Porcia was
the first ereeted at Rome. But, as Ussing remarks, this is nowhere
stated by Livy 3 and it is quite possible that during the twenty-
six years (Rc. 210—184) some other basilica may have sprung up.]

36. ‘1 will throw their fish baskcts in their faces!
38. concinnant (ef. 111 4. 69), 300 011 39.

39. locant. We must suppose that the lanii were not butehms,
but rather dealers in cattle and meam in some cases they may
have contracted to have their own cattle killed in slaughter-
houses for them. Hence concinnant (38) ‘who bring] about the
destruction of young lamhs,⁷ not slaughter them with their own
hands. Hence, too, dupla, ‘who sall lamb at double its proper
price.' [The MSS. read duplam, which might possibly mean ‘lamb
twice as old as it should be,' i.e. mutton. Ussing suggests dubium,
i.e. dc qua dumeta), utram (tyni cm ovis sit, as iu Ter. Phorm. 11 2.

42. mortalis. He humorously classes the lanius and the sheep
together as mortales.

43. To the aediles belonged the charge of superintending the
traffic in the markets. [The seventh soot is a dactyl, which is
strictly inadmissible in this place, cf. Christ Mem-ik, p. 296 and.
cf. p. 279. Br. accordingly considers the line an interpolation]
