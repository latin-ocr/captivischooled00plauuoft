2 INTRODUCTION.

Scene 2. Enter Hegio, in conversation with the Lorarius or
overseer os slaves; Hegio, evidently a man of kindly feeling,
orders him to put lighter fetters upon the two Captives3 and
after a few passages of raillery between them, the overseer
departs in order to carry out this order. Hegio then turns to
Ergasilus, who with tears describes how, in his grief on behalf
of Hegio and Philopolemus, 110 is being reduced to bare skin
and bones. Hegio is not altogether iinposed upon, and rallies
him upon his lack of spirit, telling him of his own plans for
the recovery of his son. The interview ends with the invi-
tation to dinner for which the Parasite had been angling3
although Hegio will not promise anything more than very
homely fare, Ergasilus accepts conditionally on his obtaining
no better offer, and both leave the stage.

Scene 3 (11 1), a Canticum* Enter the Lorarius, together
with the two Captives and a gang of domestic slaves, ⁸who
hang about the stage, actuated by interest in the new arrivals.
The exchange of dresses has already been effected, and Tyn-
darus is therefore regarded as the master. 'she request of the
Captives that they may be allowed to converse alone for a
moment, is readily granted by the Lorarius. Philocrates im-
plores Tyndarus to be careful and remember his part3 and.

of Plautus into five Acts is due to the grammar-iaus and ltalian editors at
the time of the Renaissanoe, the only division recognized in the MSS.
being into a number of Scmzcs. Convenience and clearness however de-
mand that soine sui-ther grouping of the aetion be111a‹l‹›; and the most
rational division seems 10 be that 11110 three Acts, containing the state-
ment, the complication, and the solution of the probleln respectively
(see 11010112, 11111. 10 Most. p. 16). There is a special reason for a new
nrrangvnient 111 1110 case os the Captivi, as 1110 old editors have evidently
blundered at the end of 1110 fourth Aci. At 1110 sanie time it seenied
desirable 10 retain the traditional division for purposes of reference, and
I have accordingly marked it throughout the play at the head of each
page. All 1110 references in the Notes and Introduction are made to
these numbers.

’κ’ Α ‘Canticum’ was properly a monologue‚ :rung or recited to the
aceompanilnent of ssutes, and usually of free or various 11101111·οῙ 00111110-
sition. But 1110 word is also applied in a wider sense 10 any scene written
in one of the longer and 1111110 passionate metres3 probably there was
always some musical aecompaniment.
