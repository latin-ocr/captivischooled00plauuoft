a change of speakers (eg. Mil. lv 8. 5, Aul. 111 6. 1) ; though
even in such cases the occurrence of hiatus is far from common.
The kind of words most subJ'ect to hiatus are monosyllables (iii) With mo-
ending in a long vowel, or in m af ter a short vowel, forming ξζζζῙΙνίἓῙῗτίεῗξ
the first syllable of an Arsis which is resolved into two shorts
(the long vowel being shortcncd by the following vowel),
eg. quad eqo Trin. Prol. 6, qui in ibid. 12, ulam eyo ibid. 1 1. 3.
While this form of hiatus is such a favourite with the comic
poets that their ear seems to have been no longer sensible of
its presence, an hiatus falling in the Thesis occurs compa· (iv)1n 'rhesis
ratively seldom even in Anapaestic verse, as Stich. 11 2. 52, ”
Quid istic inest? quas tzc ede's colubras ; and it is still rarer in
other metres, as the Trochaic Septenarius, Mil. IV 8. 20, ό mei
oculi, ό mi anime, or the Iambic Septenafius, Asin. ΙΙΙ 3. 74,

It would, however, probably be a mist-ake to deny the admis-
sibility of the hiatus in the chief Caesura of any kind of versc3
and the same remark may be applied to many other cases in
which certain scholars have attempted to reduce the multipli-
city and variety of Plautine language and verse to a law,
Many considerations may contribute to justify an hiatus in
particular instances, and each case must be judged with refer-
ence to such special considerations and on its own merits.
Thus, for instance, Corssen makes it probable that final m was
heard far more distinctly in the age of Plautus than in later
times3 if this is so, it is evident that in Plautus non-elision of
a syllable ending in m may stand on a somewhat different
footing from non-elision of a final vowel. Again, it seems
a priori probable that hiatus must have sounded differently to
Roman ears in different combinations of vowels. It can hardly
have been a matter of indifference in a question which was
largely one of euphony, whether it was an α that did not coa-
lesce with a u, or an e with an i. That such distinctions were
observed‚ and that in some cases hiatus was actually admired,

appears from Gellius (vi ξ 2-0, ed. Hertz), who speaks oi the
