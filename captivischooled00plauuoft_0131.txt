before‚' i.e. before I could have brought you news of your son.—
istuo, i.e. that my visit was inopportune.

94. illum adulescentulum, i.e. Philocrates, of whose escape Erg.
is supposed to be aware. [celox, ‘ nauigium modicum et breue 5 a
celeritate sic dictumj. cf. Asin. 11 1. 10.'—Pareus.]

95. tuom Stalagmum seruom. This order of words, which at
first sight seems strange, is the usual one ; so tna Bromia ancilla,
Amph. v 1. 28, meus Mnesilochus filins, Bacch. 11 3. 112.

[97. Sancta Saturitas, cf. ὧν ὁ θεὸς ἡ κοιλία, Philippians 111 19.]

L 98. condecoret cognomine, i.e., ficct‘cct ut clici possim Saturio.
ambin.

101. The fact that Κόρα (Proserpina) is at the same time the
name of a town in Latium (Cora), suggests to the parasite the idea
of going on swearing by the names of other towns in Latium,
Praeneste, Signia, Frusino, Alatrium‚ [all of which he makes
feminine, as though they were so many goddesses} [Schr'oder
(Programm, Marienwerder, 1853) suggests ναὶ τὰν Κόραν 3 cf. Ar.
Vesp. 1437]

[102. The reading of the MSS. Iam diu (‘was it long since‘e')
is quite out of place; for Erg. had a moment before said T amn
modo Philopolemum uidi (93) Heg. takes up the various points
of Erg.'s statement one by onc; here he should ask ‘What,
just now?’ or something of that kind, WVagner accordingly con-
jectures tammodo, which seems to have been a provincialism for
modo, see Trin. 111 1. 8, ‘T ammodo, inquit Praenestinus;' and
Festus (p. 359, 5) says ‘tmnmoczo antiqui ponebant pro ποιῶ]
Supposing Heg. to have used a provincialism, the answer of the
Parasite ‘Yes, by Praenestcl’ comes in with great effect: see
WVagner in Jahn’s Jahrb. for 1866, p. 113. T ammodo, however,
scarcely suits the metre, as the final 0 would probably be short3
and the word is far removed from the Mss]

104. Barbaficas=1talicas‚ cf. 111 1. 32 and note—quia enim
‘because, to be sure,' see note on 111 4. 36.—asperae: i.e. of
rough or harsh speech. [The Latin language is supposed to grate
upon the Greek ear. But apart from this, Plautus is very fond of
ridiculing the people of Praeneste, and especially their dialect 3
see Truc. 111. 2. 23 (ut Praenestinis “conell'' est ciconia). The
Praenestines seem to have held themselves aloof from intercourse
with Rome ; and in the year 216 nc. (not so very long before the
Captivi was produced) refused to accept the offer of the Roman
franchise (see Livy xxm 20. 2). It is not surprising if they were
unpopular.]

105. uae aetati tuae, periphrasis for uae tibi. Vae is elided,
though an interjection.

106. Quippe, elliptically, ‘ Of course i11 will betide me (uae mihi
erit), since you refuse to believe what I say, and Ι have no chance
of my reward for the good tidingS.’—-sedu10, ‘ in good earnest:
