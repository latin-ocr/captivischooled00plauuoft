hisce and uoltis.

20. abscedite to the house slaves ; nos to the other lor-arii. Tho
two prisoners thus remain watched from two opposite sides.

[21. incipisse, imperative from 2·12‹·is1is.«›.]

[22. concede huc is addi-essed to Tyndarus. Some commentators
have given the verse to Tynd. on the ground that the supposed
master ought to give the command, hut in 26, it is Phil. who actu-
ally opens ihc conversation ; and a great deal ofinitiative was allowed
to slaves, who were the confidential advisers of their masters]

23. abite ab istis to the two prisoners.— obnoxii, ‘ obliged‚' cf. Trin.
iv 3. 56.
[24. quom, see note on 11 2. lOG.-—quae uolumus, i. c. eorum qnae]

26. nunciam, not nunc iam ,· the old form of mmo was nemci (cf.
numine, Ter. Andr. lv 1. 59), as that of qnam, was quoni. Nmzcz'am
is exactly parallel to Ψιοηιάη), the -ctm in either case being an ad-
verbia] ending, giving an emphasis to the word to which it is attached.
Similarly etiaim is not from (ff, but from an obsoleto ets, allied to ἔτι.

28. neu = et ne, ‘and lest our trick so leak out,’ i. e. if we are oh-
served (the second thing to be guar-ded against is not an independent
alternative of the first>3 Pseud. 1 3. 103 Ne illam, umidas neza me

30. id, referring in a general manner to ‘loli ‘ what oncis plotting.’

31. si, ‘even though' the exe-hange of our ‹lresses has been suc-
cessfully effectetl. ·

34. For the parataxis, cf. note on 111 2. 5.

35. ero ut, i.c. ‘you may rely upon mc.’—ut‚ cf. note on 1 2. 11.

36. Nam, i.c. ‘and rightly, sor‚' ete.

37. offerre uilitati, i.c. hold cheap (properly, ‘ sacrifice to cheap-
ness'), i.c. if Heg. discovers the fraud.

[38. Soio with hiatus, justified by the change of speakers]

39. maxuma pars . . . homines, an apposition instead of the genitive.

40. impetrant, i. e. try to gain.

[43. nunc, etc. i. e. ‘As I just now (linc 35) promised to be as you
would wish mc to he, so now Ι tell you how I wish you to hehave
to me.‘—uolo‚ the indic. for suhj. in a dependent question, as so often
in Pl.; see above 14 and 111 4. 2:33 Aul. 1 1. 7 uide vt inpedit]—

[44 is corrupt 3 suadeam is perhaps traceable to εἰ audeam in the
next line 5 and meo patri is meaningless]
