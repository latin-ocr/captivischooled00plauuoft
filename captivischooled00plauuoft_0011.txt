PREFA OE. vii

they are in the main translated from the notes of Dr. Brix on
the Captivi (3rd ed., 1876), and the Trinummus (2nd ed, 1873),
where reference was made to that play in a note on the Cap-
tivi. But I have not hesitated to omit or abridge many of his
annotations, or to add others of my own, where I thought
that by so doing Ι should make this edition more suitable for
the class of readers for which it is intended. My own addi-
tions Ι have, so far as possible, distinguished by square
brackets. Here, again, Ι desire to acknowledge my obli-
gations to the notes on the Captivi by Ussing, as well as to
several articles by Geppert, Lorenz, and other scholars in
various periodical publications. Ι have been able to adopt
the view of F. Martius (Quaestiones Plautinae, Berlin, 1879)
as to the absence os the two ‘Captives' from the stage during
the first Act.

The section of the Introduction which treats of the Prosody
of Plautus, I have translated and abridged from the “Einlei-
tung’' to the Trinummus by Dr. Brix (2nd ed„ 1873) 3 for the
last paragraph on Hiatus at the end of this section, I am
myself responsible.

In conclusion, I would say that there is probably no play
of Plautus or Terence so suitable for school reading as the
Captivi. 1171181311811 or not we accept the judgment of Lessing,
who considered it to be the best play of its kind ever produced
on the stage* all must agree that it abounds in humour and
interest, and is at the same time particularly free from that
grossness which makes Plautus a difficult subject to read with
a class. The boast of the Epilogue is on the whole well
justified:

Spectat-ires, ad pudicos mores sacta haec sabulast.
