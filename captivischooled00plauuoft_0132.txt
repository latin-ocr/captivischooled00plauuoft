108. Boia. is a pun, meaning both a Boian woman, and a kind
of collar worn by slaves. Erg. says Stal. must be a Boian, because
he is wedded to a “ Βοῖα.” 'she Boii were a powerful and warlike
people of Upper Italy, who had on several occasions caused the
Romans much annoyance, especially in the Second Punic War 3
their complete subjection by Scipio Nasica and incorporation in the
province of Gallia Cisalpina (11.6. 191) was an event still fresh in
the memory of the audience.

116. Nam, see note on 111 4. 72.—mantiscinatus, a humorous
word formed from μάντις 011 the analogy of mzte'cfmzms. [No doubt
vmntz‘scinor is a very burbarous for1nati‹.›n; but perhaps it would
have been less intelligible to a Rmnan audience, if formed on more
scientifie principles. Some commentators read ‘illontia-inatus, but
have to add a word like eqo or tu in order to scau the line.
Erg. likens himself to a προφήτης Διός (cf. Pindar N. Ι. 91), one
who with full knowledge reveals to the uninspired what, is hidden
from them. An oraele did not necessarily relate to the future;
and the modern idea of ‘ foretelling' does not quit-e correspond]
—pectito‚ cf. paynel>- peclcre Men. v 7. 30, and the similar metaphor‚
fuste dolare, Hor. Sat. 1 5. 22.

118. In order to secure his position, Erg. binds his host by a
formal eontraet (stipulatio). [The question might be put by the
stipulator either as above or by any one of the following words,
Dabis ?‚ Promittis ?‚ Fc'alc promittis 2, Fide iubes· ?‚ Ele-ies 2, and tho
answer of ‘t-he promis-sor would correspond‚ Dabo, Promitto, eto]

119. respondeo here in its original and etymological signification
[which thus makes a sort of pun].

120. potes, cf. 11 3. SS.-—ambula, cf. 11 3. 92.

2. collos, cf. 11 2, 107.—tegoribus, ‘che form of terqoribzw which
is supported by A in the next scene (7) and again by BG in

3-5. Observe the alliteration.

4. absumedo, an ἇπ. λεγ., to repeat the sound of sumen, but
correctly formed on the analogy of uredo, intercapedo.

6. morast, cf. 11 3. 36. For the indic. cf. Trin. v 3. 11, nam si
pro peccatis centum deccat umores, parum-st. Poen. lv 2. 99, nanc
si eadem hic iterem, inscitia-st, [and the phrase Zonqum est‚Madv. § 348.
e. obs. 1].

in prouinciam. A praefectura was an Italian township, governed
by a praefectus iuri dicundo, who was sent out annually from Rome.
