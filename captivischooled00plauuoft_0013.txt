INTRODUCTION.

ANALYSIS or Tus PLAY.

A well-to-do citizen of Aetolia, named Hegio, was the father
of two sons, the younger of whom, Paegnium, had been stolen
away at the age of four years by a malicious slave, named
Stalagmus, and sold in Elis to the woalthy Theodoromedes. The
latter had given him, under the name of Tyndarus, to his own
son Philocrates, to be his playmate and companion. Twenty
years after this event, a war broke out between the states of
Aetolia and Elis. and the elder son of Hegio, Philopolemus,
was taken prisoner and sold, as it happened, to a client of
the very Theodoromedes who was the owner of his brother.
Hegio, who had long given up all hope of finding the lost
Paegnium, but who was anxious to recover his elder son, buys
Elian prisoners of war, in the hope of effecting an exchange;
and among others, purchases the son of Theodoromedes and
his own younger son, who had been taken prisoner together
with his young master. Thus Paegnium is a slave to his own
father, without either of them having the remotest idea of their
relation to one another. The two Captives, Philocrates and
Paegnium, who are firm friends, have agreed to exchange dresses,
the master personating the sla-ve, the slave the master, in the

- hope that they might thus bring about the escape of the latter.

At this point the play opens. The scene is laid in a city of
Aetolia and the stage represents a street, in which the house
of Hegio is situated.

capture of his young and rich patron Philopolemus.
