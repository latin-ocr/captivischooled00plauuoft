100 Norsss'. [11 3. 75—95

[75. Te. Ritschl (Neue PL Exc. 1 p. 36) proposed ted in order
to avoid the hiatus. F leck. and Brix bracket the verse as an inter-
polation, the latter on the ground that pro te is meaningless and out
of place 3 see note above, on the whole passage]

[76, 77. The verbs in these lines (ducas, deseras, des) are all sub-
ordinate to quom, and therefore not ‹zo-ordinate with iquores; it was
probably from a misunderstanding of this that atque got introduced
into some of the MSS. sor neque, 7 7.]

[78. This line is considered by Brix to be a gloss, originally writ-
{leg {¹235 margin as an explanation of 7 2, and then incorporated into

79. This verse is quoted by Nonius (p. 512) as follows: Fac
fidele se'sfidelz's, and this would be a thoronghly Plautine turn (cf.
impudenter impudens Rud. lv 3. 49, misere mis-er (list. IV 2. 21, etc.) ;
the MSS. agree in fidelis se'sfiaelelz'‚· and the adverb fidele (forfide-
liter) is not attested by any other example. In another place Nonius
quotes simile est for similis est, misunderstanding similist.

81. hunc, ie. Hegio.--inuentum inueni, cf. Cie. Fam. X1v 1. 5 uide
ne puerum perditum perdamus, and the common expression acta
affere. [‘para tibi Heyzbnem, iam paratam et quaesitam, si officium
taum facz'eS,' Lambinus]

183. Obsecro governs both haec and the following subordinate
c ause.

[84. Tu hoc age, ‘Mind what Ι say‚' more generally ‘Give me
your attention‚' as Hoc algle, sis, Olympio Cas. 11 6. 49 and Asin. Prol.
13 cf. Capt. 111 l. 20. I have kept the reading of the MSS. in spite
of the hiatus after ΐιι,· all the changes proposed are unsatisfactory,
eg. nunc hoc aye (Miiller), followed by erus mmo cs; and the hiatus
may result from the emphasis on the word ίιι,· at any rate there are
other passages in which tn. in a command stands with hiatus in the
MSS. ; see Asin. 11 2. 112 tii hunc interea laic tene, Pseud. 1 1. 31
tu hinc ex ειη-(ἱ cim—tu erus nunc es. Literally true also in a sense
which Hegio did not understand, cf. (17.1

86. Satin habes, ‘are you content.'-—facta [‘ faits accomplis'], cf.
Asin. v 2. 63 mandata dicamficcz‘a ut -zwlzwrit,

87. The first tua, is addressed to Hegio, the second to Tyndarus.
Bentley (on Ter. Haut. v 2. 24) makes a remark applicable here,
‘ uoltu et nuta haec aymatnr.‘——[ornatus, i.e. instructus, nempe Philo-
polemum reducensss Lamo]

90. eadem opera, see note on 11 2. 43.—syngraphus, ‘ passport)

92. bene ambulam, ‘bon voyage l’ WVheu one returned, it was
customary to ask ‘ benene (aithalas-ti ?' Truc. 11 4. 18.

95. Hosee. The MSS. have hos, but hosce is the proper form before
avowel or 723 see F. Schmidt in Hermes vm pp. 478—487. On the
other hand, we should write hos before aconsonant3 see Mil. 1v 2. 2.
