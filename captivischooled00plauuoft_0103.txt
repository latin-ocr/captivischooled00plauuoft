11 2. 20—40] noras 91

20. Hegio wishes to give the Pseudotyndarus a hint that his
emancipation may depend on the frankness of his avowal.—memora
:dios [cf. filus-a milei causas memora, Aen. 1 1. 8].

21. longissume, i. e. ahs-it.
22. seruitus, in Elis, under the father of Philocrates.

23. familiaris filius‚‘ son of the house ;' cf. pater, materfamilias ,-
alsofilz‘us familias, Cic. pro Cocl. 15. 36. [Notice the equivocation
in this statement of Phil., which is literally true, though it deceives

Hegio.
24. ]'I¹hales proverbially for a wise man, in Bacch. 1 2. 14, Rnd. 1v

ιιιιι

-ῒαῙθΠίιος we should expect a smaller sum, but talentmn serves the
purpose of a pun on Thales.

25. ad sapientiam; ad gives the standard by which two things are
compared3 cf. Cic. De Or. 11 6. 25 quem coqnoaz'mus uirum (senemr,
et lz‘tteratzmz, scd m'lzil ca] Pcrsz'mn; so πρός.

26. contulit, not ‘ has turned the conversation on to,' for this Hegio
had done 3 but ‘adapted his language t0‚' i.e. so spoken as though
he had really been a slave.

27. Polyplusio, ‘ the family of the Goldfields!

28. ffli=ill2·c‚ as in 73, 84, 91, as ista· sometimes=2'stz‘c.—unum
pollens atque honoraffissumum, ‘ powerful and respected above all
others.' So Amph. 11 2. 54 quam omnium leebz's uir unam esse op-
tumam diiudicat.

29. ab, i. e. qui proficiscitur ab summis αἰγίς.

31. sebum: he takes opimae in its original and material sense.—
senex, the father of Philocrates, the mention of whom occasions the
next question.

32. abimus; for the present cf. on Prol. 24.

35. Thensaurochrysonicochrysides. Perhaps we should read this
phantastic name Thensaurocroesonicochrysides (lit. son of gold, that
outdoes the treasuries of Croesus). As it stands, it means ‘ that out-
does treasuries of gold.’

36. quasi, with propter diuitias ‘so to speak.’
[38. Brix thinks this line a gloss, on the ground that in 111 4. 102

Hegio hears the real name Theodoromedes for the first time. It may
possibly, as Geppert thinks, be an ‘ aside’ to the audience]

39. quid tu ais ‘? as in Trin. 1 2. 156 Sed quid ais? to introduce
another question, ‘ What do you say to what I am going to ask you ἵ,
Eng. ‘ Hark you.' pertitam here humourously :perquam tenax.

40. ut magis noscas, i. e. ‘ I will just tell you one fact about him,
in order that} etc—quando = aliquando 5 so in the phrase si quando
‘if at any time!
