10. [Patri huiusce. Fl. proposes domino patri h., in order to avoid
the hiatus. But compare the exactly similar case in Aul. Prol. 5,
patri avoque, defended by Lachmann on Lucr. 111 941. There socrus
a special reason why huiusce should be made as prominent as possi-
ble (cf. note on Arg. l), for the person meant is not the same as the
huius of 4. Gepp. and Brix. read Huius patri iannw.]—jam h. t. The
same addrcss to tho audience, Poen. Prol. 116, Amph. 1 2. 23. [Note
the absence of an interrogative particle after r'ctm.]—optumumst. The
spectators are supposed to nod assent. [Such familiarities are quite
in the style of the Prologues3 cf. Mon. Prol. 51—55 and again 72 seq.
Even at the present: ‹lay one may hear on the Italian stage such a
dialogue as the following :

Actor. Signori‚ domani sera ci sara una rappresentazione, intitolata i tre
principi di Salerno ; il primo l⁷a1nniazzcra il secondo, il secondo l'annnaz-
zera il terzo.

One qf the ammonae, Il terzo, chi l'animazzera 3

Actor. L'anunazzerete voi S'jor Paino 3 e poi, se ci volete venir, veni-
teci3 se non ci volete venir-accidenti ἔ]

11. Negat. On the long syll. -ἷιῐ, see Introd. B [and comp. Lucr.

11 27 (fulget)].-—ultimus‚ one supposed to have come too late to find
a seat, and to be standing at the back. After accedlm we must ima·
gine a short pause3 the person addresscd showing no signs of obeying,
because he sees no room in sront, the speaker of the Prologue calls
to him, si non nbc sedeas, &Q ‘If there is no room for you to sit
down, there is room for you to take a walk (outside).’ Est uhi am-
bules is thus an indirect way of saying ccln'. similarly Mil. 11 1. 3, 4,

Qui autem asc-scultare ualet, exsurgam foras,

V t sit, ubi sedeat ille qui auscultare uolt.
Possibly there is a reference to the open promenade (mahazam-um)
attached to every theatre 3 the theatrum Pompeii (the first stone
theatro, built Rc. 55) possessed one of large dimensions (see XViese-
ler Theatergebaude, Tab. 11 12A). [Bentley (on Ter. Haut. Prol. 31)
proposed to read discedito, considering that accedito was inconsis-
tent with est uhi ambules; but the difficulty may be overcome as
above]

[13. Sense : you must be off, as otherwise you force the actor to
play the beggar, i. e. to solieit from every one present individually
the assurance that he has made himself heard, as the beggar goes
from house to house. Geppert understands mendicarier litei-ally, as
though the speaker meant that, if he overstrained and oraeked his
voice, his oceupation would be gone. So too Brix.]

14. me ...... non rupturus sum, ‘ I have no intention of cracking my
lungs' (κεκραγὼς διαῤῥαγὴσομαι), cf. Poen. 111 1. 37, tua causa nemo
nostrorum est suos rupturus ramices (blood-vessels).
