is made to D, and the fragments of readings which have
hitherto been deciphered in A are added. The first and se-
cond hands in B are distinguished as Bl and B2 respectively.
Other MSS. of lesser importanee, when mentioned, are alluded
to as Codices Elinoi-es.

The text of this edition may be presumed to contain the
reading of the MSS. B and J, unless a variationis noted in
the Critical Apparatus.

In the Critical Apparatus, the readings of editors who have
proposed corrections of the MSS, are given only in cases
where their emendations have been also embodied in the text.
An exception to this rule is made in the case of the readings
of Bentley, here published for the first time (see Presace),
which are always quoted, whether adopted or not. But in
all cases in which the text does not contain the reading of
one of the MSS. B or J, the source of the reading adopted is
indicated, sometimes by the words Cod. Min„ where it rests
upon MS. authority of seeondary importance, sometimes by
the name of its proposer, if it is a conjecture; or if this is
not donc, the inserence to be drawn is, that the correction is
one of some antiquity‚ and generally accepted in all editions*
The words or letters printed in italics in the text, indicate a
conjectura] addition, nothing corresponding to which is found
in the MSS. As a rule, it is not intended in the Apparatus
to give information as to whether a reading is to be found
or not in other editions than that in which it was originally
proposed; all that is pointed out is the source from which it
eomes. But here again I have made an exception in the case
of Bentley's emendations3 and in all cases, in which the cor-
rection has been independently made, since his time, by some
other commentator, Ι have added the name of the latter as
well. Two names also appear attached to a reading where
Bentley's correction is identical with one proposed by some
previous editor.

‘¹' Again, where the question is one of orthography, or of re-arrange·
ment of lines, 1 have not always referred the correction to its author.
