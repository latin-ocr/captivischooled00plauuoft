98 NOTES. [11 3. 44--62

[44-46. Here Tynd. is really speaking of himself, as also in 48
and 50—53 3 above (42) he reminds Phil. of the tender relationship
which had subsisted between them, here of his own past services,
and devotion to his master on the present occasion]

44. tamen is explained hythe words in tantis aemmm's, in which
there lies an implied concession. [Tamen is closely connected with
these words, though logically it- must be taken with bene qesse'sse
morem. similarly we find tamen sometimes attracted into the rela-
tive clause, eg. Lucr. v 1088 (coquntur) mecm tamen cum siut murias
emittere uoces, and 1v 106, ef. Soph. O. C. 957 ἐρημία με, κεῖ δίκαι’
ὅμως λέγω, σμικρὸν τίθησιν]

[45. te is accus. before infin„ me accus. after infin]

48. Numquam=720n. Men. v 7. 23 Nmmstmm te patiar perire.
[Compare the Eng. ‘ N ever niind.’]—gratiis is always found as three
syllables in the comic poets‚ as shown by Bentley (on Ter. Ad. 1v
7. 26). [Uss. considers that it may be here pronounced as two
syllableS, and is thus able to keep emittat of the MSS. I have fol-
lowed Geppert and Lind. in reading yraecte'is· mittat. No doubt manu
emittere is the more common expression in the comio poets sor the
later manumittere, as Er. says; but in Cure. 1V 2. 11 Β and J have
manu mittitis, for which we should probably read mittitis mama]

[52‚ 53. In these lines the speaker is really addressing himself to
Heg„ to whom his statements might seem to need justification]

53. Quo paeto, ‘and in this way.'

54. The same mistake that is here found in BJ (ista for ita) is
made in A in Epid. v 1. 16, Pseud. 11 2. 62.

[57. nam si seruos nn' esses. Phil. humorously uses words which
bear an application to the real relation between himself and Tyndarus,
yet without exciting the suspicion of Hegio—The next words (nihilo
setius fuisti) must be regarded as an anacoluthon ; instead of saying,
, you would not have been more deferential,' the speaker substitutes
the equivalent, ‘you were not a whit less deferential' (imagine a
slight pause between protasis and apodosis). Such changes of con-
struction are common enough, especially in the free style of dialogus
(cf. Ter. Hec. 111 1. 6), and there seems in this passage a special pro-
priety in the apodosis (fecisti not juisse-s), which is intended to be
equivocal, reininding the audience of the fact that Tyndarus really
Ιιαιί been as deferential as a slave. Brix conjectures nam quasi seruos
meus sis, Ussing quasi seruos meus esses]

58. Di nostram fidem, not an appeal for help, but an exclamation
of surprise, like the French ‘ma soi' [acc. of exclamation}

60. corde amare, so Truc. 1 2. 81.

[61. Seruus conlaudauit. This must have raised a laugh]

62. quam, κατά σύνεσιν 3 haud centensumam partem = multo minum

cf. Mil. 111 1. 167.
