104 NOTES. [111 2. 1—15

III. 2.

[1—11. In the arrangement of these lines 1 have followed Brix,
who has succeeded in reducing them to a system with only one slight
departure from the MSS]

2. bono publico, an ablative of attendant circumstances [‘to the
public weal,' as pessimo pumen-,0 (Livy 11 1. 3) is ‘to the deti-inient of
the public-⁷} It is not quite clear how the public interests have been
forwardcd by the purchase of Philocrates 3 perhaps Hegio is congra-
tulating both his own country and Elis on the recovery of the two
young rnen of position, Philocrates and Philopolemus. Lessing trans-
lates, ‘amid general approva13’ but the words cannot possibly bear
this sense.

3. ubi quisque m'dent. κατὰ σύνεσιν, as Men. 111 2. 56 satin ut quem—
que conspicor ita me lmlzyiccmt? Pseud. v 1. 15 alter um· alterum . . .
prehendant, etc.

5. The second syl. of Ita was originally long (see Corssen 11 p. 454)
and sometimes appears in cretio and bacchiac verse as an iambus.
[The MSS. have ‹1-et2'210ml0qne,· but qne (q ε) is a very common inter-
polation in MSS„ and it is not at all a violent change to strike it
out]

7. uix . . . . eminebam = ut m'x eminerem ,· paratactically instead of
syntactically, cf. 11 l. 34, and Mil. 1v 2. 57 ita me occursant multae :
meminisse haud possam, Men. 1 l. 18, Most. 1 2. 62.

9. The lively movement of the verse, and the short, disconnected
sentences, seem expressive of placid scltsssatisstoetion.

[13. Praeuortor domum, the reading of J and minor MSS„ must
mean, ‘I make the best os my way home ;' more literally, ‘before
anything else (as my first care) Ι turn niysclf (my steps) homewards,'
as in Horace (Sat. 1 3. 38), illac praciam-mmm· ‘ let us pay attention
to that point first of all 3' and this corresponds to what Hcg. had
said in 112. 97 (iam esso culparebo (lami). He does not here say
that 110 actually returned and entered the house; instead os that, 110
says he went riyht οη (eo protinus) to his brother's. We should cer-
tainly expect a more explicit statement, that 110 did not enter the
house3 but the apparent inconsistency between praetem-tor domum,
and eo protinus may perhaps bc explained as above z we must allow
something for the garrulous and disconnectcd style of the old gentle-
maa—Hermann explains praemorior as praetereo, and Lind. quotes
in support Virg. Aen. 1 317, prccmcvrlz‘tzcr Han-mn,- but there the
meaning is ‘ ‹nitstrip‚' and it scenis very doubtful whether the word
could mean simply praetereo. Brix and Usa, taking the reading of
B (reuertar), rcgard it as corrupt, and cancel the clause (inde . . . .
rezw7·t0r).]

[15—20. Many editors have exercised their ingenuity in arranging
these lines in a more symmetrical form, but have been driven to
introduce many changes in the text in order to effect this result. I
