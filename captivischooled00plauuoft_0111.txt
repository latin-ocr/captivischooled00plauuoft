60, Poen. 111 3. 46, v 4. 56 ς see note on 11 2. 7.—ut‚ ‘in such a way
as to act,' i.e. ‘by acting,' so 111 1. 26, Pers. 1 l. 38 To. Facere ami-
cum tibi me poti-s cs sempiternum. Sa. Quem ad modum? To. Ut
milii des nummos sescentos [cf. Ovid Fasti, 1 1. 307 sic . . . non αἱ]

65. magis belongs tomello, non to possum, cf. 111 4. 46.—opera,
‘in deed,' so Trin. 1v 1. 7 [cf. ἔργῳ], ‘ my wish to see it done cannot
be greater than will be my earnest endeavour to bring it about!

[66. The MSS. read (lo for laudo, which leaves the verse too short.
Laudo is from the grammarian Nonius, who says (p. 335, s.v. Zaa-
darc) ‘ Laudare est verbis cot'e‘rre . . . . Pl ‘lateas Captiuis : irl ut scias,

[69—85. There is a double meaning running through the whole
of this passage ; while seeming to exhort his slave not to run away,
he is really addressing a passionate entreaty to his master not to be
ungratesul (fidelis sisfidcli) 3 thus by operis et sactis he means Phil.
to understand, ‘Act up to the spirit, not merely the letter, of your
promise' (line 67) 3 so the words pro te in lines 73 and 75 are meant
for the ear of Phil. (⁴ in your place⁷)‚ while to Hegio they would merely
sound like a somewhat hyperbolical statement of the case (‘You will
be the free man instead of me, I shall be the slave instead of you‚‘ 75).
On the other hand, the words tc aestumatum (73), te hinc aestuma-
tum mittier, Nam pater faciet, etc. (80), are thrown in as explana-
tions for the benefit of Hegio]

69. operis. The plural again, Bacch. 1 1. 11 (45), Asin. 11 4. 19,

far as I have not said.' So Ter. Eun. 1v 5. ll correxit miles, quo
intellexi minus (where qao, the reading of A, has been corrected to
quod, which also stands in the other MSS.).—[de te, ‘about you)
Tynd. desires Phil. to understand, ‘If Ι have not said all the good
of you that Ι could have wished (since in appearing to praise you, I
was really praising myself), reflect upon the cause (animum adnortas)
and do not take offencel]
