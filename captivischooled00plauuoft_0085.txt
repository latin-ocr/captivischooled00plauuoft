ARGUMENT.-It is Ritsclil’s opinion (Proleg. Trin. p. 317) that
all the argumenta prefixed to Plautus’ I'lays belong to the second
century aster Christ3 whereas Teuffel and Seyffert hold that tho
aerosfflcs, the great majority, were written during the scvcnth cent.
A.V.G.‚ i. o. about 100 years aster the death of Plaut.

[1. in pugna, with hiatus in the caesura of the iainbic senarius. In
this instance there is a special justilication for the hiatus in the fact
that it occurs hqfure (ι proper namt», which is made more prominent
and distinct when it is entirely severed in pronunciation both from
the word that precedes and that which follows. Even Rit— c'il (Pro-
leg. Trin. p. 204 sol.) conceded the hiatus with proper nanez in two
passage83 so Hegio with hiatus again in 111 4. 73, v 4. 27,- on the
other hand, with elision in 1 2. 77, 111 4. 802]

2. alium for alteram, and again amittatur (7) for [mnsam-etur (ef
however Mil. 11 1. 53), as well as the whole structure of the aei-ostie,
betray the shaekles under which the composer was labouring. [The
line is a reminiscenee of 111 5. 102]

3. Aleos, see on Prol. 9. [Borrowed from 1 1. 32]
4. gnatum captum, i.e. Philopolemus, cf. v. 1.
5. [inibi‚ the reading authorized by the MSS„ means here ‘among

them} cf. the Eng. ‘thel-ein.⁹ So Aul. Gell. xvn S J‹‘2·‹2aesa«12.‹ cicc.)- ,

cucco-bitae inibi minutim caesae. So with other adverbs, eg. unde
(from whom) m'l majus qam-atur ipso Hor. Od. 1 12. 17 : the hiatus
after the second thesis need not cause any difficulty, especially in one
of the Argumenta Acrostieha, when we reinember their probable
authorship. Most editors accept the conjecture [22v ibus, an old Latin
form with the termination of the 3rd decl. z cc's. In favour of this
it might be pleaded that the writers of the Argu ments and Prologues
undoubtedly aiined at imitating the language and prosody of Plautus3
thus in this aci-ostie the foriu CAPTfflvffl (ef. however Amph. Arg.
1 3 Alcmena, whereas Plautus always has Alcumena, four syllables).]
—amissum, Tyndarus (Paegnium, v 3. 7).

6. uorsa, i.e. changed.

7. amittatur in the sense of dimittatur, as often in Plautus, e. g.
Mil. 1v 3. 3, Most. 11 2. 2, Men. v 8. 6.——ut amittatur, i.e. nc dumi-
mcs am. We should expect a more explicit antithesis (at illc cmz.),
