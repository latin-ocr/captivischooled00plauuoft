111 4. 30- 42] NOTES. 107

ironically [like the English ‘very likely: ‘I (lare say‚’ or the F1-..·11‹‚·h
‘11 en a l'ai1·']. So Pocn. 1 1. 13, Acon. Lanos-cere irl te rai aequom est.
ῘΜιιΡ. Haud uidi maffl‘s! sc. aequom, ‘ Oh, of course, bare justiccl'
and Amph. 11 2. 57fAMP11. Euymvtcdn-sne aduenio? Sos. Haud

uidi maffl's expectatum, quem salutat mauis haud qaisquam quam
mumm- and Merc. 1v 3. 24.

30. In order to excite Arist. 'to a pitch of sury which should
resemble real madness, Tynd. compares him with three celebrated
madmen. The last, Lycurgus, King of the Edones of Thrace, was
punished with madness for his attaek upon the worship of Dionysus.
[Alcmaeo, Ἀλκμαίων. Alcmaeon was a celebrated person on the
tragic stage, as Gepp. say-3, and it is hardly likely that Plaut.
woultll1 have rechristened him Alcumeus (so O. Ribbeck)]—postea,
‘ in t at case.’

31. una. opera . . . qua, ‘just as much as,' cs. on 11 2. 43.

35. uero, ‘ in reality‚' modal abl„ not the adversative particle, so
Most. 1 3. 21, mauis uituperarz'erfalso, quam uero attolli? Mero.
1v 1. 19, Truc. 11 2. 47. Sometimes joined with ssa-ia, Amph.
111 3. 9 (equidem serio ac uero ratus), Pseud. IV 7. 96 (rcymndc lmc

uero serio). So in the phrases αἰη uero? itane uero? ita hercle
uero, etc.

36. [Ironically, ‘It was reserved sor you, Ι suppose, to prove
your superiority to Phil. in exactness of statement? Tynd. desires
at the same time to give Arist. a hint that his superior information
as to the person of Phil. is rather inopportune.]—enim is osten
found in Plaut. as an affirmative or asseverative (not illative)
particle, especially in the combinations (ct enim, quia enim, von
enim, m'l enim, nunc enim, certe enim, immo enim, and enim uero
(thus Trin. 111 2. 79, non enim possum quin exclamem), but also
in other connections, eg. Cas. 11 4. 2, Te uxor aiebat tna me
uocare ‚· ST. qu enim uocari iussi cf. Trin. v 2. 10.

37. ut rem uideo, ‘to the best of my judgment‚’ cf. Truc. v 70,
ut rem natam uidea—uam'tudjne :mendaciis [cf. Virg. A. 11 80,
neque . . . uanum etiam mendacemque improba flasset—uera
conuincas, ‘ put truth in the wrong ' ].

41. Alidem without a preposition only in this place, cf. 11 3. 19,
111 4. 56. So Alide without ῑή only in 11 2. 80. The simple acc.
and abl. (without a preposition) of names of countries seems to
have been a peculiarity of early Latin, for Alis is not to be
regarded as the name of a town 3 so ‘nequinont Graeca'ctm redire
(Livius Andronicus), and even later Nep. Milt. 1 OEzersomzesum
mittere, Dat. IV Aeqyptzmz proticisci. But at the time of Plaut. it
was becoming usual to insert the preposition.

42. According to old Roman law the slave is a chattel,
possessing neither father nor the right-s of contracting a legal
marriage and holding property, in a word, without ‘ caput' ot
‘status' [See Ramsay, Rom. Antiq. p. 83.]
