short vowel long by position3 hence such words as ayris, libros,
duplat, can never be scanned as spondecs.

But it was Accent that had the most extensive influencc in
altering the natural quantity of syllables. While the delibe-
rate and stately language of oratory did full justice to the
length of the unaccented ending in such words as (Ζόγηῖ, σᾶσᾶ,
in spite of the accent on the short first syllable, in the more
hurried speech of every-day intercourse it was found tiresome
and inconvenient to follow „up an accented short by an unac-
cented long syllable, and every iambic dissyllable was accord·
ingly weakened into a pyrrhic. Hence in the comic poets we

not unfrequently find such words as domi, preti, boni, bonzs,
foris (fores), manu, modo (abl), dccli, scanned as pyrrhics3 nay,
iambic Imperatives are usually found with their last syllable
shortened, e. g. tene, vide, abi ; whereas Ennius in such cases as
a rule restored the iambic scansion. We may express this in a
formula by saying that {amb = pyrrhic. The following instances
may be quoted from Plautus and Terence: πόυᾶ pictura (abl.)
Mostell. Ι 3. 105, πόύὅ liberto Epid. V 2. 61, bonas ut aequomst

Side by side with this weakening of final vowels, and aris-
ing from the same cause, we find a corresponding obscuration
of certain final consonants, as in the words enim, apud, quidem,
parum, soror, caput, amant, habent, for which the more ancient
inscriptions often show capu, quide, paru, Sto* Consequently
the last syllable of such words, followed by a consonant, are
not necessarily long by position3 thus, prdem recedas Capt. ΙΠ

is really due to the accent on the preceding short syllable, is
