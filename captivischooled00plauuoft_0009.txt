PREFACE ΤΟ ΤΗΕ FIRsT EDITION.

IN preparing an edition of a play of Plautus for the use of
my pupils in the Humanity Classes of the University of Glas-
gow, it has been my aim to put into their hands not merely a
commentary which should serve as an introduction to the
study of Plautus, but also a text founded upon the best MS.
authority available‚ and cognizant of recent labours in the field
of Plautine criticism. No edition of Plautus seemed to me to
meet these requirements so well as that of Dr. Julius Brix,
whose Trinummus, Captivi, Menaechmi and Miles Gloriosus,
are already well known in this country3 and it was originally
my intention simply to produce his Captivi in an English
dress. My request for permission to do so was met by Dr.
Brix with a cordial and ready assent, and a promise to send
me further notes and corrections which had suggest-ed them-
selves to him since the appearance of his last edition. Though
in the course of my work Ι have been led considerably to
modify and extend my original plan, I desire here to express
my great obligations to the work of Dr. Brix‚ without which
my edition could never have been produced, and the hope
that he will pardon me if in some places Ι seem guilty of pre-
sumption in venturing to dissent from the ripe judgment of a
veteran critic of Plautus like himself.

The text of the present edition of the Captivi is founded
upon a collation of the two most important MSS„ the Codex
Vetus and the Codex Britannicus, known since Bitschl as
B and J respectively. For the readings of the former, I am
chiefly indebted to the edition of Plautus by Ussing, who col-
lated this play at Rome; in cases of doubt, I have consulted
Pareus (2nd edition, Frankfort‚ 1623). The collation of the
Codex Britannicus Ι have myself made. It would certainly
have been desii-able to add a collation of the Codex Ursinianus
(D), which contains the first 500 lines of the play3 but I had
no means of access to this MS„ and have therefore been
obliged to content myself with an occasional quotation of its
