86 NOTES. [1 2. 71—85

‘Going, going, gone 1· (i. e. Ι accept your invitation, unless some ore
makes me a better offer). In answer to Erg.’s protest against a too
stingy entertainment, Hegio humorously proposes to settle the matter
by a formal contract (stipulatio), Erg. making his demand as to each
item os the feast (rogare), and Hegio declat-ing his consent or refusal
(promittere). There is a good instance of such a contract⁴ in full
(here merely hinted at in the word rosaz) in Bacch. lv 7. 40 seq. The
parasite, replying to this jest with another, represents invitation and
acceptance of invitation as a bargain for sale, 111 which Hegio appears
as snirchaser, Erg. as vendor, the article to be sold to the highest
bidder being the company of Erg. at (himen—[Emptum (tibi est) is
the formula employed in concluding a bargain3 cf. Epid. 111 4. 39
Estne empta νηί haec? PE. Ilis- levibus larinus- licat]

71. condicio came to be used technivally, as Uss. says, sor an in-
vitation or engagement; cf. Mart. XI 52. l ε
Cenabis belle, Iuli Cerealis apud ine ;
Condit-io est melior si tibi nulla, veni.
73. By profundum of course understand uenter, so barathrum (Cure.
1 2. 32).

7 4. em, ‘look you.’ This form of the demonstrative particle en
(acc. of the pronoun is) is strongly supported by the MSS. in many
passages of Plautus and Terence, and sometimes demanded by the
metre. The interjection Item, which is frequently confounded with
it in the later, and occasionally even in the earlier MSS„ is an
entirely different word, an expression of strong emotion (joy, sorrow
or surprise).

75. Heg. compares his own humble dinner to a weasel, a more
sumptuous one to a hare.

76. My fare is like a rough, stony road, and a dinner with me a
tough picce of work to get through.

77. Sense ‘ No, it won't do ; you can‘t frighten me off like that.'

79. sane concessive. ⁴ Your well-shod teeth will be necessary.'—
essitare frequentative, formed by adding -ita to the supine stem <in
which the final dental of the root appears as s before s). Similar
formations are curs-itare, haesitare, nent-iture, etc.

80. terristris cena ‘a countrified meal‚‘ i. e. quae nihil nisi terra
natum hahet.

81. multis holeribus descriptive abl. i. e. without meat—[curato
aegrotos, 1. e. vegetahles are siek man's fare]

82. Numquid vis? ‘is there anything more I can do for you 'l'
the usual formula in leave-taking. Cf. Hor. Sat. 1 9. 6. So too
nmnqw’d aliml? Capt. 11 3. 88.

85. iri. For the pres. instead of the fut. infin. after verbs spe-
randi, pronzae'ttzfuclt', etc. (as in Eng. ‘ I hope to do it), cf. Trin. Prol. 5
