11 1. 16, deartuatus ibid. 111 5. 14, deosculari, &c.; intro ire is
not a case in point, because intro and ire (so intro and mittere,
rmnpcm, (lucere, ferre) always form two separate words. In
the forms exibam, audibam, scibam, dinae, ditior, the synizesis
has even stamped itself upon the spelling ; likewise in quattor
(for quattuor, see Ritschl Rhein. Mus. V111 p. 309), mensum,
ccmcwztam, decentum„ so that we are not surprised at omnium
occurring as a dissyllable, Trin. IV 2. 88, V 1. 1. On the other
hand, vowel contractions like qrcctias, otio, filio, yatadiis, are
found only in the more unwieldy metres, which are exempt
from many of the ordinary rules, that is to say, the Troch. Tetr.
Aeat. and the Anapaestic measures; while in the commonet
and lighter ones they are not permitted. Thus, for instance,
the word 9111113, which is always found in its contracted form
in later times, never appears in Plautus or Terence except
with its full ablative terrnination as gratiis (and so iozyratiis).

Not the least diffieult among the many difficult questions
that arise 111 connection with the verse of Plautus is the deter-
mination of the extent to which, and conditions under which,
he permittecl himself the use of Hiatus, and a few words must
be said about it here. In general, no doubt, the Romans re-
garded the hiatus as anything but a beauty. They were so
much 111 1116 habit of eliding their vowels‚ that Cicero says
(Orat. ξ 150) z Nemo tecm rusticus cst, qm: vocales nolit eony‘zcnyere.
Hence in Plautus we should expect to find hiatus chiefly in
those cases where a break in the metre or in the sense occa-
sioned or perinitted a pause in the speaker's utterance. As
metricat pauses allowing of hiatus may be reckoned the Oaesura
in the Cretic Tetr. (Trin. 11 1. 37 Fleck), in the Bacch. Tetr.
(capt. 111 2. 8), 111 1116 Troch. Tetr. Cat. or Acat. (Capt. 11 2. 81,
IV 2. 66, 81, V 2. 24), in the Anapaest. Tetr. (Mil. IV 2. 23, 65),
and the Iainb. Tetr. Cat. (Scptenarius). In some of these exam-
ples the metrieal pause coincides with a pause in 1116 sense ; yet,
on the other hand, an overwhelming majority of verses written
