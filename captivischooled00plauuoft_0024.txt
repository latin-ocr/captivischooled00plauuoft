12 INTROD UOTION.

the omission of the labial b has permanently stamped itself
upon the orthography of the lauguage.

It must be noted, however, that there are a few words in
which shortcning frequently takes place in cases which exceed
1110 11111115 above laid down. These words are ille, iste, unde,
inde, ozempe;* and we must ascribe the shortening in such
cases to the special and peculiar character of these words.
Worn down, like small change, by constant use in conversa-
tion, they had one and all lost their accent: unde, inde, nempe,
had-suffered consonantal wcakening to such an extent that in
common talk the liquids π and m were almost inaudible3 iste
had a collatcral sOl'ln stc, latcly rescued from its obscurity by
Lachmann, Lucr. p. 197 (sce also Corssen, ii. 629); lastly, in
ille scarcely more than a single consonant was heard, as we
might gathcr from the sorinations cllum, ellam (en-illum, en—
isum, en-lum, ellum), and from the very frequent pyrrhic scan-
sion of illic (the pron, not the adv.). Another exception, which
does not belong to the group just mentioned, is frustra: this
word, elsewhere a spondce, must apparently be taken as a
trochee in Plautus, on the strength of six passages in which
there is 110 reason to suspect a corruption in the MSS: Capt.
IV 2. 74, Rud. IV 3. 30, IV 7. 29 (klock), Mero. ΙΙΙ. 1. 30, Pers.
1 3. 00, Μο11. IV 3. 18. In all these passages the phrase is the
same, frustra sis .· in other verses of Plautus and in all of Terence,
frustra is found either with the second syllable elided, or in a
position in the verse from which we can draw no conclusion
as 10 115 quantity. Another word 111 which the practice of
Plautus deviates from that of later times is ficri (fierem), the
first syllable of which is long in the Cretic close of iambic and
trochaic verses, eg. Capt. IV 2. (33, v 4. 1, Bacch. IV 5. 18.

We now pass to another and entirely different set of pheno·
mena in the prosody of Plautus. Many of the terminations
which we are accustoined to find short in 1110 poets of the
Augustan age, but which were originally possessed of a long
vowel, were, at the time when Plautus wrote, in a transition
