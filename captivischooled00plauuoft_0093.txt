close to the Tiber, lay directly on the line of traffic between the
Emporium οι* merchant d‹›‹.·k‚ which was just outside the gato, and
the city. [It is not certain what is the meaning of saccus here ; 11
is nowhere (else) applied to a hvggar's wallct. Near the Porta Trig.

parenthetical remark. The sentence commenced in 24 <Nam pust-
