ιν 3. 8-4. 14] NOTES. 121

Erg. speaks of himself as such a governor, cf. Cas. 1 11, quin rari
es in praefectura tua? (of a ‘vilicus '). [The restoration of this verse

is due to Geppert, who discovered traces of the lost words in the
Ambrosian Palimpsest.]

[8. indemnatae “ quasi rei, qui indemnata causa suspensi iudicium
expectent.'’ Usa]

 

Iv. 4.

[The grammarians and editors who dividcd the play into five acts
ought clearly to have begun the fifth here, and not aster this scene.
For some considerable interval of time is necessary, if the account
given by the boy in lines 6—10 of the doings of Erg. is not to
appear grossly improbable 3 whereas no pause is needed at the end of
this scene. But it would be better to give up the division into five
acts altogether]

[4. This line lacks some syllables 3 but all the conjectures hitherto
proposed seem liablo to serious objections. Lind. supplies si .th
after quasi, but the present is the wrong tense 3 C. Bothe (Quaest.
Gramm. p. 36, Berlin, 1876> proposes esset ; but in such expressions,
as Br. remarks, it is not the custom of Plaut. to use the verb esse at
all, cf. Poen. v 2. 7 4 quasi proserpens bes-tica]

[5. The fragment of this verse, which Geppert has been able
to read in the Ambrosian MS„ is found nowhere else. Ι have given
his conjectura] restoration in the text 3 but it need hardly be said
that the reading cannot be considered certain]

¹7. deturbauit, ‘he pulled down meat hook and all,' instead of
cutting off a portion of what was hanging on it.

8. glandium, a glandule of the throat 3 the ylandulcze in a pig are
what the tonsillae are in a man.

10. seriae, ‘ preserving pans ,·’ the saucepans he did not consider
large enough'for his purpose. [The scansion coczYm pe'r. is defended
by Mulier Pl. Pros. p. 93. At the beginning of ‘the verse some
licence is allowed 3 see Christ, Metrik, ξ 400, cf. § 346]

ll. omnes, forthere were several, e. g. olearia, uinaria, penaria.—
reclusit. The long syll. re· is to be explained from the old form of
the prefix red- (as in redimere, redire, redinteqrare, reddere, etc.) 3 the
forms redcludo‚redcido became first, by assimilation of the consonants,
recoludo, reccido (redduco required no change), then, with a long
vowel to compensate for the loss of a consonant, recludo, recido,
reduco, and finally with a short vowel, recludo, rccz'do, reduco.

13. sibi, an iambus see on V 1. 19.—Construe: si quidem uolet
sese uti sc. penu.

[14. The verse is unmetrical as it stands in the MSS. 3 adopting
Lind.'s correction, we must scan nam without elision—iam, erit 3
for iam with the future cf. Aul. 11 2. 26, iam ad te renorma] “
