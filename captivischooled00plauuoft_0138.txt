126 Norsss. [v 4. 9—31

9. quid gnate mi? ‘What do you mean by {fluite mi?' The
words that excite surprise are usually repeated without alteration :
Bacch. 1 2. 39 P1. Omitte, Lyde, ιω caece malo. LY. Quid ‘cane
malo'? So in ΜΠ. 11 3. 45, Rud. 111 4. 31, Cas. 11 8. 18 seq„
11 5. 41.

11. lucis: during his brief term of punishment he has had to
break stenes sul) terra. The word lux is generally masc. in Plautus,
as Aul. 1v 10. 22 [cf. 1Vagner's note]; Cist. 11 1. 58 (also Ter. Adel.
841); fem. only in Amph. 1 3. 49 lace clara et emedida. [The
present passage, however, might be explained differently, as
containing the Same construction as ozomt'mzmli aetorum, 1v 2. 72.
In both cases the genitive depends on the word copim]

12. Et tu=you also.

17. Illic, i.e. Stalagmus, ‘ the slave,' in order to distinguish him
from is (15), Theodoromedes—[una. The MSS. have hunc, but
this would not be Latin ; see on Prol. 2.]

[18. intus eccum, cf. 1 2. 60 (eccum hic) and note. In neither case
is the person alluded to on the stage]

19. ais. For the long final syll„ see Intr. B.—The MSS. here,
as osten, transpose the last two words in the line3 so even the
Ambrosian Ms. in one passage.

[21. Br. considers that lines 14-—20 are an interpolation, made
by some person who thought greater detail was necessary, and that
the end of 14 and the beginning of 20 were altered to suit the
insertion]

25. Probably an alternative reading (suggested orig. in the
margin) for the next line.

26. In memoriam regredior, cf. Cic. Verr. 11 1. 46 redite in
onena—,rima italicas ,· the memory is regarded as something objective‚
or exter-nal to the subject.

27. Quasi per nebulam3 the same phrase Pseud. 15. 48. [The
words must here be joined with in 77?‹377107·2'rlm ressredt'or, which is
equivalent to ‘1 reeolleet.' The pause in the sense thus gives a
ground of justification for the hiatus, which also precedes a proper
name: see Intr. D (ii).—-'1'liere is nothing impossible in this
recollection on the part of Tyndarus of a name not heard since the
age of four years, though the passage has been objected to as an
ilnprobability, see in Lessing (Kritik, ete.)].

29. id praeuerti, cf. 11 3. 100, 111 2. 14. The aec. of the pron. id
(so hoc, illud) reru-esents a dative of a subst. Sometimes the idea
of prae· is strengthened by the addition ofprimum.

31. reete feceris, se. si quid mihi dederis. The company of
actors, or one actor in their name, speaks the Epilogue, which
bears traces of the same hand that eomposed the Prologue. [ef.
ad pudicos mores with neque spurcidici insunt uorsus inmemorabile!

l'rol. 56.]
