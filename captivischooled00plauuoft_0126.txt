114 NOTES. [xv 1. 8—2. 11

8. sine sacris hereditas is synonymous with ‘pure gain! Pro-
perly it means an uneneumbered legacy, one which did not involve
as a condition the obligation to maintain the sacra domos-tica or
pria-uta (see Cic. de Leg. 11 9, SACRA PRIVATA PERPETVA
MANENTO). The same expression in Trin. 11 4. 83. Cena hae
annonast sine sacris Icereditas.—ecfertissimus Participles sometimes
receive the terminations of the comparative and superlative degreeS.
Thus Trin. 11 3. 6 factius (from factus), id. 1 2. 185 occlusior.
The later literar-y language employs scarcely any except auctior,
emendatior, accuratior.

11. certa. res est, ‘ 1 have made up my mind.’

12. conficiam, in order to free the body for running the pallium

[11. Que which the MSS. give after interminor is a common
mistake, see 111 2. 5: Eminor interminor is an expression like dico
edico (uobis nostrum esse illum. erilem filium), Ter. Eun. v 4. 40, and
other formulae (dieo fnterdico). Most modern editors reject emz'nor,
a word which certainly occurs nowhere else, but which is not only
in itself unobjeetionable‚ but strongly supported hy eminatio (19).
