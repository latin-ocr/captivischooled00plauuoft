The MSS. of importance which cont-ain the Captivi are ι

(1) The Codex Vetus (B), a MS. of the 11111 century, now
in the Vatican Library at Rome. It was originally discovered
in the middle of the sixteenth century by the great German
scholar Joachim Camerarius, and is the main authority on
which the text of Plautus rests. It contains all the twenty
comedics. The original reading of B has been in many places
corrected by several hands of various ages, the most important
being the so-called “ manus seczmcla.”

(2) The Codex Britannicus (J), a MS. also of the end of
the llth 01· beginning os the l2th century, probably of English
origin, and now 111 the British Muscum. It contains only eight
plays, the simplam-uo, Asinaria, Aulularia, captari, Curculio,
Casina, Cistellaria, and Epislc'eas. It has severely suffered by
fire, the beginnings or ends of lines being often quite illegible.

(3) The Codex Ursinianus, or Vaticanus (D), a MS. of the
12th century, now 111 1110 Vatican, and containing, besides the
last twclvc plays, the Amphitruo, Asinaria, Aulularia, and
about one half of the Captivi (to ΙΙΙ 2. 4). This MS. was the
chief authority for the text of the plays which it contains,
until the discovery os the Codex Vetus by Camerarius.
